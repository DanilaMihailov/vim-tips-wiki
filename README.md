# Vim Tips Wiki
**1500+** tips downloaded from [Vim Tips Wiki](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki), parsed and formatted to look and work like native Vim help files. 

You can use `:helpgrep` to search tips, `Ctrl-]` to jump tags and `gO` (thats capital o) to see table of contents. All tips are numbered and tagged in a format `vtw-N` where `N` is number of a tip. 

Try `:help vtw-1`. Checkout plugin help `:h vim-wiki-tips`, theres lists of tips sorted by order, alphabet and category. And there is command `:RandomVimTip` that opens random tip.

**NOTE**: this plugin is *NOT* related to [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) (amazing plugin btw).

## Why, though?
Sometimes I find myself using `:helpgrep` and not finding what I am looking for, often because I did not use correct word or phrase. I hope that having 1500+ tips written by users will help solve this problem.

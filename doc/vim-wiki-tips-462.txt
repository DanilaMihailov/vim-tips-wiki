==============================================================================

Place the cursor on any variable in your program.
    - `gd` will take you to the local declaration. 
    - `gD` will take you to the global declaration. 
    - `g*` search for the word under the cursor (like `*`, but `g*` on 'rain' will 
      find words like 'rainbow'). 
    - `g#` same as g* but in backward direction. 
    - `gg` goes to the first line in the buffer (or provide a count before the 
      command for a specific line). 
    - `G` goes to the last line (or provide a count before the command for a 
      specific line).

    - `gf` will go to the file under the cursor |vwt-299| 
    - `g]` and other commands will jump to a tag definition 
      [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Browsing_programs_with_tags] (a tag can be a 
      function or variable name, or more).

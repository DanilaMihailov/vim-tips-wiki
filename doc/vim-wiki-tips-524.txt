==============================================================================

The <CTRL-R>= things evaluates the expression. For example:

>
    <CTRL-R>=12+34<CR>
<

<CTRL-R>= works in insert mode and in command mode. I felt it more convenient 
if <CTRL-R>= did the same thing in normal mode too.

I have this in my vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    map <CTRL-R>= :echo
<

Now <CTRL-R>=123*456<CR> evaluates expressions for me in all 3 modes: normal 
mode, insert mode, and command mode. In fact I found it much more convenient 
to do casual calculations using <CTRl-R>= in normal mode than in any other 
mode.

Be warned: when typing <CTRL-R>= in normal mode, don't make long pause before 
'='. <CTRL-R> alone means 'redo' in normal mode. Vim is very smart, and 
figures the difference between single <CTRL-R> (which is 'redo') and the 
mapped sequence <CTRL-R>= (which is remapped). The 'timeoutlen' option 
controls this difference. The default value of 'timeoutlen' option is very 
convenient.

This is an expansion of Using Vim as calculator |vwt-73|.

COMMENTS  *vwt-524-comments*

To get the behavior like i_CTRL-r in normal mode, use @=. For example, in 
normal mode, @='dd'<CR> will delete the current line just as if you had 
pressed dd in normal mode.
    - :help  |@|


For more information. You can also do things like

>
    :let @a = 'dd'
<

and then press @a in normal mode. This does the same thing.

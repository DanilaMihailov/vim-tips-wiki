==============================================================================

If you want to change just one or two colors in your syntax highlighting, 
there is a simpler way other than editing color files (or creating new ones). 
For example, I wanted to tweak the default colors a bit, so I added the 
following lines to my vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] file:

>
    highlight comment ctermfg=lightblue
    highlight constant ctermfg=red
<

This made the comments and constants easier to read on my screen. Replace 
"comment" or "constant" with whatever text type you want to change the color 
of. Try experimenting with different colors to see what looks best to you. 
(This was NOT gone in the gui vim, as I don't use it/have it installed).

COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-737-comments*

In vim 7.2 this makes the given element bolded as well as changing the color.

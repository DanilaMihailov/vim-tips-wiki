==============================================================================

When doing a complex substitution with a regular expression, it's useful to 
first search for what you want to replace, to confirm that the search pattern 
works. Or, just press `*` to search for the current exact word |vtw-1|, 
followed by ```` (two backticks) if you want to jump back to your original 
word.

To do the substitute, type:

>
    :%s//New String/g
<

In this substitute, the search pattern is empty, so it will use the last 
search.

Alternately, you can press Ctrl-r followed by `/` to insert the last-search 
register (for example, you might want to edit the command before pressing 
Enter):

>
    :%s/<c-r>//New String/g
<

If the pattern is in a register, say the `a` register, you can press Ctrl-r 
then `a` to insert the contents of the register at the appropriate place in 
the command.

    - why would anyone use ``? Just get accustomed to CTRL-o and CTRL-i and enjoy. 
      - Because, it does almost the same thing, but is easier and faster to type if 
      you only need to go back a single position.

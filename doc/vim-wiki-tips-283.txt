==============================================================================

Some versions of Mac OS X don't have syntax highlighting support in terminal 
Vim with default settings.

If you don't have syntax highlighting in any Vim, first make sure something 
like this is in your .vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    filetype plugin indent on
    syntax on
<

If you have that, and still don't get syntax highlighting in Vim running in a 
terminal (i.e. not a GUI like MacVim), you may need to inform Vim how to 
handle the terminal.

Something like this is needed, prior to the syntax on command in your .vimrc:

>
    set term=builtin_beos-ansi
<

Others (on "Mountain Lion" and "Sierra") reported success with this instead:

>
    set term=builtin_ansi
<When using iTerm 2, you can simply do:

>
    set term=xterm-256color
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-283-comments*

The following worked great on OSX 10.10.3 Yosemite, and OSX 10.12.4 Sierra. I 
tested it with .py, .html and .php. Thanks!set term=builtin_ansi Worked like a charm on OS X 10.9 Mavericks, Thanks.



set term=xterm also works on OS X 10.9 Mavericks

set term=builtin_beos-ansi worked like a charm in OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite. 
Thanks!

Disclaimer: Under 10.9 Mavericks with an external keyboard, term=builtin_ansi 
may make the delete key next to the end key change the character under the 
cursor rather than delete as expected. term=xterm has this key behave as 
expected.

DinVim is a vim for Mac OS [http://dinvim.com] that supports syntax coloring 
out of the box.

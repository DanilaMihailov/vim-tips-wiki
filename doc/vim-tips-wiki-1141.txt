This command (`PP`) prints lines (like `:p` or `:#`) with the search pattern 
highlighted. I use `g//p` quite often, and I was missing the highlighting of 
search pattern. To test this command, try something like:

>
    :g/a/PP
<

If you supply the optional argument `#` (`PP #`) then line numbers are also 
printed.

>
    " command PP: print lines like :p or :# but with with current search pattern highlighted
    command! -nargs=? -range -bar PP :call PrintWithSearchHighlighted(<line1>,<line2>,<q-args>)
    function! PrintWithSearchHighlighted(line1,line2,arg)
      let line=a:line1
      while line <= a:line2
        echo ""
        if a:arg =~ "#"
          echohl LineNr
          echo strpart(" ",0,7-strlen(line)).line."\t"
          echohl None
        endif
        let l=getline(line)
        let index=0
        while 1
          let b=match(l,@/,index)
          if b==-1 |
            echon strpart(l,index)
            break
          endif
          let e=matchend(l,@/,index) |
          echon strpart(l,index,b-index)
          echohl Search
          echon strpart(l,b,e-b)
          echohl None
          let index = e
        endw
        let line=line+1
      endw
    endfunction

Just a small issue, it chokes on:

>
    :g/^/PP
<

==============================================================================

A small addition:

>
    nmap [I :execute 'SS g/\<' . expand( '<cword>' ) . '\>/PP #'<CR>
<

Changes the behaviour of the internal `[I` to highlight the text now.

I noticed that it breaks on ^ and $ (if they're alone), also, but that 
doesn't really happen that often.

==============================================================================

I think you meant (without SS):

>
    nmap [I :execute 'g/\<' . expand( '<cword>' ) . '\>/PP #'<CR>
<

Yes, `[I` with highlighting is a great idea. Now the only thing lacking is 
the jump numbers at the start of each line that are right-aligned.

About choking on ^ and $ anchors, it actually poses minor practical problems. 
Searching for ^ or $ alone is useful to indicate the whole line. In the case 
for ranges:

>
    "print lines 3 to 34, including empty lines
    :3,34g/^/p
    "how would we do this without using ^ or $?
    :3,34g/\_./PP
    "is almost the same but not quite (at EOF)
<

Anything that can possibly evaluate to matching nothing but anchors ^ or $ or 
void will choke it too. But these aren't practical:

>
    :g/^\s*\(function\)\=/PP
    "number
    :g/^\s*\d\{,4}/PP
    "trailing spaces
    :g/\s*$/PP
    "dash line
    :g/-*/PP
<

==============================================================================

>
    ...
     let e=matchend(l,@/,index)
    + if e == b
    + let e = e+1
    + endif
    ...
<

should solve problem with zero length regexps - they are displayed as in Vim 
- next character is highlighted. (there is still another problem with match 
function - so '^', '\<' aren't matched correctly)

==============================================================================

and this:

>
    - echon strpart(l." ",b,e-b)
    + echon strpart(l." ",b,e-b)
<

will display '$' correctly too.

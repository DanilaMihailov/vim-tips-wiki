==============================================================================

Using the Windows installer to install Vim with default settings will put the 
executable in a directory with a name like C:\Program Files\vim\VimXX (where 
XX is a number such as 72 to indicate version 7.2). When the next version is 
installed, files will be placed in a new subdirectory, for example Vim73 for 
version 7.3. This tip describes how to handle the fact that you may have 
registered Vim as the editor to be used with various applications, and now the 
path to the executable needs to be changed in multiple locations.

STANDARD PROCEDURE  *vwt-1670-standard-procedure*

The Vim Windows installer offers an option to create a batch file in a 
directory in the PATH so that batch file can be used to invoke Vim. Just use 
this batch file to register Vim everywhere. When a new version of Vim arrives, 
modify this file only (or the installer can do it).

Problems:

OVERWRITE OLD VERSION  *vwt-1670-overwrite-old-version*

Install the new version of Vim on top of the old one.

Problems:

DIRECTORY LINK  *vwt-1670-directory-link*

When installing Vim on an NTFS file system (pretty much all new computers), 
do the following:

When a new version of Vim arrives, do the following:

That way, all Vim settings throughout the system should pick up the new Vim 
version.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1670-comments*

The easiest way I've found to handle a Vim version upgrade (and also, 
incidentally, to enable a quick setup on any new system), is to create a .bat 
file or a registry export file which can be used to create all your file 
associations. When you upgrade, simply change the path to Vim in this 
script/registry file and re-run/re-import it to override all the old 
associations with the new. --Fritzophrenic

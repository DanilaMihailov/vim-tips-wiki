When I use Vim I have multiple windows open which are all maximized after 
becoming active, see for example VimTip173 |vtw-173|.

This makes debugging code in combination with the quickfix window a little 
difficult. After switching from the quickfix window to the code, the quickfix 
window is minimized and the error message is out of sight. Put the following 
in your gvimrc to keep the quickfix window at a user specified height:

>
    " Maximize the window after entering it, be sure to keep the quickfix window
    " at the specified height.
    au WinEnter * call MaximizeAndResizeQuickfix(8)
    
    " Maximize current window and set the quickfix window to the specified height.
    function MaximizeAndResizeQuickfix(quickfixHeight)
      " Redraw after executing the function.
      set lazyredraw
      " Ignore WinEnter events for now.
      set ei=WinEnter
      " Maximize current window.
      wincmd _
      " If the current window is the quickfix window
      if (getbufvar(winbufnr(winnr()), "&buftype") == "quickfix")
        " Maximize previous window, and resize the quickfix window to the
        " specified height.
        wincmd p
        resize
        wincmd p
        exe "resize " . a:quickfixHeight
      else
        " Current window isn't the quickfix window, loop over all windows to
        " find it (if it exists...)
        let i = 1
        let currBufNr = winbufnr(i)
        while (currBufNr != -1)
          " If the buffer in window i is the quickfix buffer.
          if (getbufvar(currBufNr, "&buftype") == "quickfix")
            " Go to the quickfix window, set height to quickfixHeight, and jump to the previous
            " window.
            exe i . "wincmd w"
            exe "resize " . a:quickfixHeight
            wincmd p
            break
          endif
          let i = i + 1
          let currBufNr = winbufnr(i)
        endwhile
      endif
      set ei-=WinEnter
      set nolazyredraw
    endfunction
    
    " Remap ,m to make and open error window if there are any errors. If there
    " weren't any errors, the current window is maximized.
    map <silent> ,m :mak<CR><CR>:cw<CR>:call MaximizeIfNotQuickfix()<CR>
    
    " Maximizes the current window if it is not the quickfix window.
    function MaximizeIfNotQuickfix()
      if (getbufvar(winbufnr(winnr()), "&buftype") != "quickfix")
        wincmd _
      endif
    endfunction

Shouldn't you be save/restoring those global values:

>
    " Redraw after executing the function.
    set lazyredraw
    " Ignore WinEnter events for now.
    set ei=WinEnter

==============================================================================

Here is how to calculate the sum of all numbers matching some pattern, for 
example, the first number on each line with a number, or the numbers following 
a $ ($10+$20). This version only handles unsigned integers.

SUM FUNCTION  *vwt-205-sum-function*

First, define the following function.

>
    let g:S = 0  "result in global variable S
    function! Sum(number)
      let g:S = g:S + a:number
      return a:number
    endfunction
<

In Vim, you could copy the above lines then type :@" to execute the copied 
lines (to define the function). Or, you could put the code in a file in your 
plugin directory, or in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

The function adds the given number onto the sum in the global variable S. The 
function returns the given number so that it can be used in a substitute 
command without changing the number.

USAGE  *vwt-205-usage*

Suppose you have this text:

>
    Here are some items:
    Take 10 apples
    and 20 pears
    then 30 walnuts.
<

You can add the numbers with these commands:

>
    :let g:S=0
    :%s/\d\+/\=Sum(submatch(0))/
    :echo g:S
<

The first line clears the variable used to hold the sum. The third line 
displays the sum.

The substitute replaces the first occurrence of \d\+ (one or more digits) on 
each line. The replacement \= is the result of the expression Sum(submatch(0)) 
which calls the Sum() function. The submatch(0) is the text matched by the 
search pattern (the number which was found).

Using the following would include all numbers in each line:

>
    :%s/\d\+/\=Sum(submatch(0))/g
<

This adds only the numbers following a $ character (the \zs starts the search 
hit after the $ is found):

>
    :%s/\$\zs\d\+/\=Sum(submatch(0))/g
<

This adds only the last number on each line that contains a number:

>
    :%s/.*\zs\d\+/\=Sum(submatch(0))/
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-205-comments*

If you want to replace the numbers in the file with a running total, in the 
Sum() function, replace:

>
    return a:number
<

with

>
    return g:S
<

FLOATS  *vwt-205-floats*

Float numbers could be handled easily:

>
    :%s/\d\+/\=Sum(str2float(submatch(0)))/g
<

The above does not work because the search pattern only finds unsigned integers. Also I do not think str2float is needed. This might be fixed and moved back into the tip. JohnBeckett (talk) 06:13, September 9, 2014 (UTC)

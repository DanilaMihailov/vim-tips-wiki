It is easy to search for the word under the cursor using the super star 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Searching] (`*`). Here is how to search all files 
in a directory.

Enter the command `:set grepprg?` to determine what program is used on your 
system to execute the `:grep` command. If it is the `grep` utility, the 
following mappings allow searching files in a directory for the word under the 
cursor.

>
    :nnoremap gr :grep <cword> *<CR>
    :nnoremap Gr :grep <cword> %:p:h/*<CR>
    :nnoremap gR :grep '\b<cword>\b' *<CR>
    :nnoremap GR :grep '\b<cword>\b' %:p:h/*<CR>
<

The first mapping searches for the text in the word under the cursor (like 
`g*`) in any of the files in the current directory.

The second mapping searches for the text in the word under the cursor (like 
`g*`) in any of the files in the same directory as the current file.

The third mapping searches for the whole word under the cursor (like `*`) in 
any of the files in the current directory.

The fourth mapping searches for the whole word under the cursor (like `*`) in 
any of the files in the same directory as the current file.

On a Windows system, 'grepprg' may be set to use the `findstr` utility. In 
that case, the last two mappings should be:

>
    :nnoremap gR :grep "\<<cword>\>" *<CR>
    :nnoremap GR :grep "\<<cword>\>" %:p:h/*<CR>
<

It would be nice if this tip also metion how to browse through the returned 
locations.

See the Find in files within Vim tip. There's not really much here that isn't covered there. --Fritzophrenic (talk) 17:30, November 27, 2012 (UTC)

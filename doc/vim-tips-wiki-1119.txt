==============================================================================

I use Vim for all text editing, even software development. At one point I 
stopped using IDEs. One major reason is that Vim can do all the major things I 
need from IDEs (tabs, file trees, grepping, syntax highlighting, indentation, 
completion, "quickfixing", etc).

VIM PLUGINS                                             *vtw-1119-vim-plugins*

Still Vim needs plugins to do some IDE-like things that aren't built in. Here 
are some Vim scripts that make Vim more like an IDE.

The plugins listed below are all great; the one additional plugin that really 
makes vim feel like an IDE for me is ale [https://github.com/w0rp/ale] -- the 
Asynchronous Lint Engine. It runs various tests in the background and 
highlights errors in your code with annotations in the side margin. Incredibly 
valuable.

Note: You can use pathogen 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332] to isolate your 
plugins and make it easier to experiment with new plugins.

PROJECT/FILETREE BROWSING                 *vtw-1119-project/filetree-browsing*
    - NERDTree [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658] is a tree 
      explorer plugin for navigating the filesystem. 
    - vtreeexplorer [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=184] is a 
      tree based file explorer. 
    - project [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69] gives you a 
      "project" view of files, rather than a straight file system view 
    - ide [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3855] Tracks files 
      status (open/edited/closed/read only) within a project with icons; 
      automatically builds and updates syntax highlight rules based on the project 
      files (C/C++/Java); avoids buffer duplication. 
    - :help |netrw| for information about the explorer distributed with Vim. It 
      does not display files in a tree by default, but can by using the 
      |g:netrw_liststyle| option. It also offers useful file-sorting options (by 
      date, size, name). 
    - Luc Hermitte's local_vimrc [https://github.com/LucHermitte/local_vimrc] and 
      Markus "embear" Braun's local_vimrc 
      [https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc/] manage projects as files in a same 
      directory tree. 
    - Tim Pope's Projectionist [https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist] #4989 
      provides granular project configuration using "projections".

      "Go to File" window bound to Command-T in TextMate 
    - MRU [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=521] access recently 
      opened files. 
    - ctrlp [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3736] Fuzzy file, 
      buffer, mru, tag, ... finder with regexp support. Written in vim language. 
      Access all the functions with ctrl-p

      classes, e.g. C++, Java, Python. 
    - Indexer [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3221] generates 
      tags for all files in project automatically and keeps tags up-to-date. Using 
      ctags. Works well with project plugin or independently. 
    - CCTree [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2368] is a Call-Tree 
      Explorer, Cscope based source-code browser, and code flow analyzer. 
    - exUtility [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1729] global 
      search, symbol search, tag track...(Like IDE/Source Insight). 
    - ShowMarks [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152] visually 
      shows the location of marks. 
    - lh-tags [https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-tags] automatically updates the 
      ctags database, and provides alternatives to `:tselect` to navigate code.

==============================================================================

Code navigation in vi offers much more than a standard IDE, because of the 
ability to execute the desired combination of commands. Generate an index much 
more rapidly than an IDE with a heavy GUI:

For example, one can take advantage of the tag stack:

For C++, follow the instructions: on using OmniCpp 
[http://design.liberta.co.za/articles/code-completion-intellisense-for-cpp-in-vim-with-omnicppcomplete/]Define 
a custom .ctags file

--c++-kinds=+p
--fields=+iaS
--extra=+q
--language-force=C++

From a console (the exclude options may vary) generate the tags file as 
follows:

>
    ctags --exclude=.svn --exclude=target -R .

PRECONFIGURED VIM AS IDE                   *vtw-1119-preconfigured-vim-as-ide*

You can find preconfigure VIM as IDE environment created by Damian Ziobro on 
GitHub:

https://github.com/xmementoit/vim-ide [https://github.com/xmementoit/vim-ide]

It contains preconfigured BASH script to install it on your Ubuntu (not 
tested on other OSes). In order to install vim-ide on Ubuntu, you need to do 
following steps:
    - back up your previous vimrc configuration 


>
    cp $HOME/.vimrc $HOME/.vimrc.bak
<
    - clone vim-ide repository to your HOME directory 


>
    cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/xmementoit/vim-ide
<
    - install vim-ide in your system 


>
    cd vim-ide && ./installVim.sh
<
    - explore possibilities and plugins of vim-ide repository in $HOME/.vimrc and 
      $HOME/.vim. Ex. open main.cpp file 


>
    vim /tmp/main.cpp

==============================================================================

It is possible to install several different releases of Vim (for instance, 
Vim 6.3 "stable" and Vim 7.0 "alpha") on a single computer and decide at 
run-time which one to use. The present tip tells how. However, it does not 
solve all of the problems; in particular, it tells how to use either one or 
the other but not both by the same user at the same time. (It is possible to 
use both at the same time if "users" are different, or if the matchit plugin 
is not used.)

1. One version should be chosen as "default", normally the more stable one. 
It will be accessible via the PATH, through one of the following methods:

a. Put the name of its directory in the PATH: for example, on Windows 98, 
AUTOEXEC.BAT may contain:

>
    ...
    set VIM=C:\PROGRA~1\vim
    ...
    path %VIM%\vim63;%PATH%
<

b. Have a soft link to it in a directory in the PATH, for example on Unix you 
may have a soft link /usr/bin/vim pointing to /usr/share/vim/vim63/vim

To use the non-default version (or, on Windows, the default when you are in 
the directory of the other one), use a full path. In the case above, you will 
invoke the default Vim as "vim" and the other one as (for example, on Windows) 
%VIM%\vim70aa\vim

2. The permanent environment may possibly contain a VIM variable (which may 
for instance be set to C:\PROGRA~1\vim on Windows or to /usr/share/vim on 
Unix) but not a VIMRUNTIME variable. Each executable will select a different 
$VIMRUNTIME according to its version number. If VIM is unset, Vim will 
normally set it correctly; but even if you use the default it can be useful to 
set VIM in the permanent environment so that the shell can see it: indeed, it 
is much easier to type cd $VIM than cd /usr/share/vim; or %VIM%\vim70aa\gvim 
filename.ext than "C:\Program Files\vim\vim70aa\gvim" filename.ext. For best 
results on Windows, use "short" directory names in the value of VIM, HOME, 
etc. (as in the W98 example above).

3. The "system-wide customizations" in $VIM/vimfiles and the "user-specific 
customizations" in $HOME/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles will be common to the 
different versions; any differences can be resolved by testing the value of 
v:version at run-time.

4. Each distribution should have its own distribution tree at the proper 
place under $VIM, for instance $VIM/vim63 for stable release 6.3 (at any 
patchlevel) or $VIM/vim70aa for alpha release 7.0aa (at any snapshot date). If 
you install via a pre-compiled archive or installer, it should select the 
proper default. If you compile your own, the subdirectory name is the value of 
the constant VIM_VERSION_NODOT defined in src/version.h

5. Now we come to the ticklish point: the matchit plugin. It comes with each 
distribution, with its own script and helpfile, but they are deactivated by 
default and they may vary from version to version. They are however, very 
useful; but how can we sure of using the right one? Here is how I solve the 
dilemma: I use a small "system-wide" plugin $VIM/matchit.vim to automatically 
select the right plugin at run-time (the first line takes care of the plugin 
itself; the rest is for the help file. This "fancy footwork" is needed to 
avoid changing the distribution files in or under $VIMRUNTIME.) Note that the 
following assumes that different users may use both versions at the same time, 
but that a single user will not. The contents of that scriptlet is shown here; 
it assumes that +eval (expression evaluation) and +windows (the ability to use 
split windows) have been compiled-in. In other words, the "normal" feature set 
should be enough. (With only "small" features, we can't use the :if statement 
and that's a big handicap.) This plugin also assumes that there exists a "doc" 
subdirectory in ~/vimfiles or ~/.vim for "user help files". You should create 
that directory if it doesn't yet exist.

$VIM/vimfiles/plugin/matchit.vim:

>
    runtime! macros/matchit.vim
    split $VIMRUNTIME/macros/matchit.txt
    if has("unix")
      saveas! ~/.vim/doc/matchit.txt
      helptags ~/.vim/doc
    else
      saveas! ~/vimfiles/doc/matchit.txt
      helptags ~/vimfiles/doc
    endif
    close

    - Maintain multiple versions of gvim in Windows 
      [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Maintain_multiple_versions_of_gvim_in_Windows] 


The philosophy is different: the present tip applies to any OS: it relies on naming one version the "default" and having it in the PATH; other versions must be invoked with an explicit path. The tip named above is only for recent versions of Windows, naming an alternative to Unix's long-established soft links, and tells you how to change the default between a number of installed versions.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-848-comments*

Actually, the current matchit plugin and help for 6.3 and 7.0aa are 
identical, so if that's the ones you have, there is no need for "fancy 
footwork" to get the right helpfile. Just source the macros/matchit.vim plugin 
and leave the help files alone.

==============================================================================

Anyway, I find that I can live with "not changing the help files" even if it 
means that I'll occasionally be running with a matchit help for a different 
(later?) version of matchit than the one I'm currently using (when using a 
version of Vim other than my "default Vim"). -- Tonymec

Syntax folding is a much better way to accomplish this. Many syntax files 
(including C and Perl) already define this folding, or you can make your own.Tip 916 [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/View_only_what_you_are_editing]   Previous |vwt-915| Next |vwt-917|

==============================================================================

Ever have a giant file with many function definitions you want to hide while 
you edit only a few functions? Folding (see :help |:fold|) is a great way to 
"shrink" a file down to size, while you concentrate on a few fragments of the 
file you're editing. Putting the following Vim function definition in a file 
(I always name it ".vimrc") in the same directory as the file you're editing, 
allows you to hide all the functions you want (provided you bracket using the 
style below, notice the {}'s on their own lines):

>
    sub foo
    {
      some code ...
    }
<

To use it, source the file, then do :call HideFunctionDefs() to invoke the 
function, which will hide the bodies of the functions you don't care to see.

The following example hides foo1, foo2, foo3, and foo4.

>
    function! HideFunctionDefs()
      if search("sub foo1") > 0
        normal! jv%zf
      endif
      if search("sub foo2") > 0
        normal! jv%zf
      endif
      if search("sub foo3") > 0
        normal! jv%zf
      endif
      if search("sub foo4") > 0
        normal! jv%zf
      endif
    endfunction
<

If you bracket like this:

>
    sub foo {
      some code ...
    }
<

Replace all instances of `normal! jv%zf` with `normal! f{v%zf`.

To hide more functions, add more if-endif blocks substituting `sub foo_` with 
the names of the functions you want to hide.

You might find it easier to manage if you do something like:

>
    :set foldmethod=marker
    :set foldmarker={,}
<

Alternatively, consider passing in the bit after "sub " as a parameter to the 
function, and then simply call HideFunctionDefs( 'foo\d\+' ) -- you'll have to 
change HideFunctionDefs to go over all instances of the search, though, which 
means you should probably change your foldmethod to expr and set your foldexpr 
to another function that you write.

I fear you've been getting less-than-stellar reviews because it's too manual 
a process to fold away the functions using your technique.

Personally, I use the standard foldmarkers ({{{ and }}}) and place them in 
comments. This is much more flexible as it is language independent and you can 
better define what is folded. For example, you may have a block of code that 
is quite long, not necessarily a function, and you want to hide it. I've done 
this with long queries in ColdFusion pages.

Also, using the above suggestion, you can have a lot of nested folds since 
every time you have a {,} combination, it will fold it. This includes if 
statements, case statements, etc.

Perhaps it is worth mentioning zf<motion> as a convenient means of folding 
something. In particular I've found zfa{ to be convenient.

Perhaps :help |:syn-fold| will help you. Here is an extract:

>
    :syn region myFold start="{" end="}" transparent fold
    :syn sync fromstart
    :set foldmethod=syntax
<

==============================================================================

I'm using Vim to program C#. Visual Studio uses some markers as the 
following:

>
    #region My Region
      ..code..
    #endregion
<

I'm using the .cs-Syntax file for Vim and defined my foldexpr so that all 
#regions are folded automagically. It's very useful especially if one is 
working in a team with others using Visual Studio.

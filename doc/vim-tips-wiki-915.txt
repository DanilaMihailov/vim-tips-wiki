I re-fell in love with `:g/` when I discovered `norm f{char}`. In the 
following sample text, say you want to delete the two words between the name 
and the IP address, and "has address" isn't spelled consistently throughout 
(preventing us from using `:s/has address//`). You can do this:

>
    :g/\d\+\.\d\+\.\d\+\.\d\+/norm f w2dw
<

The above command changes this:

>
    yahoo.com has address 216.109.112.135
    yahoo.com is address 66.94.234.13
    google.com is IP 216.239.37.99
    google.com has IP 216.239.57.99
    google.com has address 216.239.39.99
    msn.com has address 207.68.172.246
    vhost.sourceforge.net is address 66.35.250.210
<

to this:

>
    yahoo.com 216.109.112.135
    yahoo.com 66.94.234.13
    google.com 216.239.37.99
    google.com 216.239.57.99
    google.com 216.239.39.99
    msn.com 207.68.172.246
    vhost.sourceforge.net 66.35.250.210

EXPLANATION                                              *vtw-915-explanation*

The command

>
    :g/\d\+\.\d\+\.\d\+\.\d\+/norm f w2dw
<

finds each line matching a pattern, then performs a command on the line. The 
pattern is the regular expression between the slashes

\d\+\.\d\+\.\d\+\.\d\+

which matches an IPv4 address consisting of

one or more digits followed by a dot (\d\+\.) followed by
one or more digits followed by a dot followed by
one or more digits followed by a dot followed by
one or more digits

The command to be perfomed on the line is

norm f w2dw

which is a normal-mode command consisting of

f<space>

to find the first space after the cursor, then

w

to move forward one word, then

2dw

to delete 2 words (2 is the repeat count).

Or you could use :s

>
    :%s/\s\zs\w\+\s\+\w\+//
<

Actually, this would work ':%g//norm f w2df ', assuming that the columns are 
separated by spaces instead of tabs.

==============================================================================

The "`.`" command repeats the last change made in normal mode. For example, 
if you press `dw` to delete a word, you can then press `.` to delete another 
word (`.` is dot, aka period or full stop).

The "`@:`" command repeats the last command-line change (a command invoked 
with "`:`", for example `:s/old/new/`).

You can move the cursor before using either of the repeat commands.

Suppose you press `dd` to delete a line. Next, you might move the cursor, 
then press `5.` (`5` then dot). That will delete 5 lines.

In normal mode, press `J` to join the next line onto the current line. Press 
`.` to join more lines.

Or, you might use insert mode to type "`hello `". Press Esc for normal mode, 
then move the cursor, and press `.` to insert "hello " again.

COPY A WORD TO MULTIPLE LOCATIONS   *vwt-44-copy-a-word-to-multiple-locations*

Type `yiw` to copy the current word. Move the cursor to a new location, then 
type ciw<C-R>0<Esc> to change the word, replacing it with the copied text. 
After moving the cursor to a new location, press `.` to repeat the operation 
(the current word will be replaced with the word that was originally copied). 
See replace a word with yanked text 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Replace_a_word_with_yanked_text].

COPY A LINE TO MULTIPLE LOCATIONS   *vwt-44-copy-a-line-to-multiple-locations*

Move the cursor to the wanted line and press `Y` to copy it. Move the cursor 
to a new location, then press `p` to paste the line after the current line, or 
`P` to paste before the current line. After moving the cursor to a new 
location, press `.` to repeat the paste.

It is also possible to paste the copied line over the destination (replacing 
the current line). To do that once, copy the wanted line with `Y`, then move 
to the destination, press `V` to visually select the destination line, then 
`p` to paste the copied line over the selected line.

A different procedure should be used if the replace operation needs to be 
repeated. Move the cursor to the wanted line and type `0y$` to copy the line, 
without the line ending (`0` moves to the beginning of the line; `y$` copies 
to the end of the line). Move the cursor to a new location, then type 
S<C-R>0<Esc> (`S` then Ctrl-R then `0` then Escape). After moving the cursor 
to a new location, press `.` to repeat the operation (the current line will be 
replaced with the line that was originally copied).

Explanation: Pressing `S` deletes all text from the current line (but not the 
line ending) and starts an insert operation. In insert mode, pressing Ctrl-R 
inserts the contents of a register. Register `0` (zero) contains the text that 
was copied with `y$`.

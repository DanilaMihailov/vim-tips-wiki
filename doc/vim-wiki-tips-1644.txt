==============================================================================

In Latex, in-text formulas are surrounded by a pair of $ signs. The following 
plugin plus bindings allow operation on these formulas using the usual syntax 
for text objects in Vim. This allows for quick yanking, changing and deleting 
of such formulas which are very common tasks when writing mathematical text in 
Latex.

For information on operator pending commands and omap see here 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Mapping_keys_in_Vim_-_Tutorial_(Part_1)#Operator_pending_mode_maps].

Install CountJump [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3130] and 
add the following code to your ftplugin/tex.vim file.

>
    call CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch('<buffer>', '$', 'ai', 'v', '\$', '\$')
<

Now you can yank, delete, etc entire formulas using i$ for interior and a$ to 
include the bounding dollar signs.

For example, if you put the cursor inside a formula and type yi$, this will 
yank the interior of the dollar signs. Typing da$ will delete the entire 
formula including the dollar signs.

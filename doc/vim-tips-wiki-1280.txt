==============================================================================

This tip requires the netrw and Project plugins. The netrw plugin should be 
included with every version of Vim since 6.0, and the Project plugin is 
available at script#69 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69].

Using the Project plugin to organize, edit and read remote files is an 
excellent idea. For example, let's say that you're administering 10 Unix 
servers, and have the following file on each server: `/opt/myapp/etc/myapprc`

Also, let's say that you need to check this file on a couple of machines a 
day and occasionally compare files. Instead of logging into multiple machines 
(and using a differently-configured text editor on each machine), you can just 
set up the following Project file:

>
    myapp_config=/home/someguy/logs/myapp_config CD=. {
      scp://server1.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server2.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server3.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server4.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server5.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server6.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server7.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server8.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server9.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
      scp://server10.domain.com///opt/myapp/etc/myapprc
    }
<

The netrw plugin allows you to edit and read these files in a fairly 
transparent manner. And if you're using scp and ssh-agent, you can work with 
all of these files without even using passwords. Also, if you wanted to do a 
vimdiff of two of these files, you can open one of them using the Project 
plugin and use the `:diffsplit` command to open the other file.

==============================================================================

Here are some suggestions that may help when editing PHP files.

MOVE TO NEXT VARIABLE ON CURRENT LINE *vwt-1527-move-to-next-variable-on-current-line*

PHP variables start with '`$`', for example, `$var`. In normal mode, type 
`f$` to jump forwards to the next variable; repeat by pressing `;` (next, in 
same direction), or `,` (next, in opposite direction). Typing `F$` finds '`$`' 
in the backwards direction. :help |f|

If you do this a lot, you may want to use the following mappings in your 
vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] so you can press `L` to jump to the 
next variable, or `H` to jump to the previous variable:

>
    noremap L f$
    noremap H F$
<

FIX 4 INSTEAD OF $                               *vwt-1527-fix-4-instead-of-$*

It's easy to press `4` instead of `$`, resulting in code like this:

>
    $var = "sometext"; echo 4var;
<

With the following map, you can quickly fix this problem by typing `\4` while 
the cursor is still on the same line, after the '4' (this assumes the default 
backslash <Leader> key):

>
    nnoremap <Leader>4 F4r$A
<

Here is an alternative that returns the cursor to its initial position:

>
    nnoremap <Leader>4 m`F4r$``
    inoremap <Leader>4 <Esc>m`F4r$``a
<

ABBREVIATIONS TO INSERT DEBUG CODE *vwt-1527-abbreviations-to-insert-debug-code*

The following abbreviations provide an easy way to enter debug code. In 
insert mode, type `phpb` then the name of a variable to be displayed.

>
    iab phpb exit("<hr>Debug ");
    iab phpv echo "<hr><pre>";var_dump($a);exit("debug ");
<

These display any variables that have been yanked into register `a`:

>
    iab phpbb exit("<hr>Debug <C-R>a ");
    iab phpvv echo "<hr><pre>";var_dump(<C-R>a);exit("debug ");
<

`Var_dump` is used for displaying arrays.

This displays all defined variables:

>
    iab phpallv print_r(get_defined_vars());
<

REPLACE ASSOCIATIVE WITH OBJECT STYLE NOTATION *vwt-1527-replace-associative-with-object-style-notation*

The substitute command presented below looks for each PHP array reference 
like:

>
    $a = $some_array['key_name'];
<

and replaces it with:

>
    $a = $some_array->key_name;
<

Command:

>
    :%s/\['\(.\{-}\)'\]/->\1/gc
<

In the above, the `c` flag prompts for confirmation of each change.

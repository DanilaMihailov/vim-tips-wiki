==============================================================================

I love the text folding capabilities of Vim. I didn't like that it would 
display the first line of the range as the "title" for the fold. I like to 
write my comments with the "/*" on a line by itself. So I wrote this little 
function that will skip over anything that isn't a character, and then display 
whatever it finds after that character.

Just include this in your vimrc:

>
    function GetFirstLineWithChars()
      let line_num = 0
      let charline = matchstr(getline(v:foldstart), '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z ]*')
      while strlen(charline) == 0
        let line_num = line_num + 1
        let charline = matchstr(getline(v:foldstart + line_num), '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z ]*')
      endw
      return charline
    endfunction
    
    set foldtext='+'.v:folddashes.substitute(GetFirstLineWithChars(),'\\\/\\\/\\\|\\*\\\|\\*\\\|{{{\\d\\=','','g')
    set fillchars=fold:
    hi folded guibg=black guifg=yellow gui=bold
<

And as an added bonus, for those new to text folding, add this to your vimrc 
file too:

>
    autocmd BufWinLeave *.* mkview
    autocmd BufWinEnter *.* silent loadview
<

That way whatever folds you set won't get lost when you quit. I had that 
happen after spending 15 minutes folding up a 3000 line file.

COMMENTS  *vwt-122-comments*

The line that looks like "set fillchars=fold:" has a space at the end. Simply 
type <C-k><Space><Space> to reproduce it. It's just a space.

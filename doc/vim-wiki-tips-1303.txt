==============================================================================

It is possible to paste the contents of any register into the current buffer 
or command-line.

IN NORMAL AND VISUAL MODES  *vwt-1303-in-normal-and-visual-modes*

In normal and visual modes, "xp pastes the contents of the register x.

This works with special registers as well: "+p (or "*p) pastes the contents 
of the clipboard, "/p pastes the last search, and ":p pastes the last command. 
For example, you might want to save a complex search and replace (:%s///g) 
that you have just used, which you can do by pasting with ":p.

IN INSERT AND COMMAND-LINE MODES  *vwt-1303-in-insert-and-command-line-modes*

In insert and command-line modes, you can use <C-R> to paste the contents of 
a register (:help |i_CTRL-R|). In particular, <C-R>" pastes from the default 
(unnamed) register, which is analogous to doing p in normal mode.

Note that because Vim faithfully translates the contents of the clipboard to 
a buffer in insert and command-line modes, using <C-R>+ is susceptible to 
attacks if the contents of the clipboard cannot be fully trusted. This is 
sometimes called "clipboard hijacking". For instance, if one copies text from 
a website that contains a literal escape character (i.e. the character with 
ASCII value 27, not a representation of the escape character such as <Esc>), 
Vim will faithfully switch to normal mode and begin executing normal mode 
commands. Some browsers hide special characters when displaying a page, so it 
is not immediately obvious even if one has copied malicious text. Moreover, 
using clever div-tag positioning, even browsers that display special 
characters are susceptible to such attacks (proof of concept 
[http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste]). It is possible to use 
<C-O>"+p, <C-R><C-R>+ (:help |i_CTRL-R_CTRL-R|), and similar commands instead, 
which prevents attacks of this form.

If one prefers to continue using <C-R>+ to paste from the system clipboard, 
one of the following mappings can be used:

>
    " Pick one
    inoremap <C-R>+ <C-R><C-R>+
    inoremap <C-R>+ <C-R><C-O>+
    inoremap <C-R>+ <C-G>u<C-\><C-O>"+gP
    inoremap <C-R>+ <C-G>ux<Esc>"=@+.'xy'<CR>gPFx"_2x"_s
    exe 'inoremap <script> <C-R>+ <C-G>u' . paste#paste_cmd['i']
<

For the first mapping, see :help |i_CTRL-R_CTRL-R|.

For the second mapping, see :help |i_CTRL-R_CTRL-O|.

The third mapping will temporarily switch to normal mode without moving the 
cursor, and then paste. It first uses <C-g>u to break the undo sequence so 
that the pasting can be undone. Then <C-\><C-o> temporarily switches to normal 
mode without moving the cursor. It then accesses the + register and uses gP 
instead of the usual P to paste so that the cursor is positioned after what is 
pasted (just like the default <C-R>+). Note that because the clipboard is 
pasted in "one move" instead of being translated character-by-character (the 
default behavior), formatting options such as textwidth are not obeyed (use 
something like gqip to fix the formatting; see :help |gq|).

The fourth mapping employs the strategy used in paste.vim 
[https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/8aba95097305b77d56adce507793e331e895a601/runtime/autoload/paste.vim#L32-L34] 
(when virtualedit is unavailable). This mapping forces Vim to paste 
characterwise (:help |characterwise-register|) even if the register contains 
linewise text. This is useful if you always want Vim to start pasting where 
the cursor was on the line. Select some lines using V, then yank with "+y. Now 
enter insert mode in the middle of a line. The behavior of the first mapping 
would be to jump to the previous line and insert the lines there (thus not 
changing the current line), whereas in most other text editors the text is 
pasted in the middle of the current line (since most text editors don't 
distinguish between linewise and characterwise operations).

The fifth mapping is essentially from mswin.vim 
[https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/6c35beaa11d38fc0c37a3d209295772313b12003/runtime/mswin.vim#L47]. 
If Vim was compiled with virtualedit, it takes advantage of this to paste 
linewise and blockwise text in a more Vim-like manner. If Vim is not compiled 
with virtualedit, it falls back to the behavior of the previous mapping.

Even with the above mappings, the default behavior can still be retrieved by 
waiting a moment after typing <C-R> (so that Vim gives up on trying to use the 
custom mapping).

COMMENTS  *vwt-1303-comments*

This illustrates the hijacking point. Executing the following puts some text 
in the a register.

>
    :let @a = "abc\<Esc>:echo 'gotcha'\<CR>"
<

After that, pressing i to enter insert mode, then typing Ctrl-R a inserts 
"abc" but then executes the echo command. The Vim procedure to insert the keys 
literally is to press Ctrl-R twice. That is, type Ctrl-R Ctrl-R a which will 
insert the escape and newline (carriage return) characters into the text.

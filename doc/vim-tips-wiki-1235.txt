==============================================================================

Here is how to define and use a calculator, using embedded Python.

These two lines go in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    :command! -nargs=+ Calc :py print <args>
    :py from math import *
<

Now use it inside Vim:

>
    :Calc 2**10+5,2**16,2**128
    1029 65536 340282366920938463463374607431768211456
    :Calc sin(pi/2), log(10)
    1.0 2.302585
<

You have to have Vim compiled with Python support, and have Python on your 
machine† |vtw-1235-dll|. Use `:version` to see which features are included in 
your Vim.

If you don't have Python support in your Vim, but do have a python command, 
use this instead

>
    command! -nargs=+ Calc :!python -c "from math import *; print <args>"
<

You also get complex numbers and other goodies. Google for Python and math. 
Here is an example from complex math:

>
    :py from cmath import *
    :Calc exp(pi*1j) , " Euler famous identify e^i.pi = -1"
    (-1+1.22460635382e-016j)
    
    :Calc sum(range(1,100+1)), "Gauss' famous identity sum(1,100)"
    5050

These days, Vim Python support in Windows is usually via a dll, installed 
separately from Vim: `:version` shows `+python/dyn`. Go to http://python.org/ 
[http://python.org/] to get the Python installer.

To check whether you have Python software that Vim can use (either statically 
linked or dynamically findable), do :echo has('python') — 0 (zero) means "no", 
anything else (normally 1) means "yes".

If your Vim (7.2 or later) is compiled with |+float|, you can do scientific 
calculations in Vim even without Python.
    - Use the numeric operators (except %) and floating point functions defined by 
      Vim, see - :help |expr5| - :help |expr6| - :help |expr7| - :help 
      |function-list| and scroll down to `Floating point computation` 
    - Exponentiation is pow( |pow()|base,exponent), not `**` 
    - |:echo| gives you 6-digit precision by default, use |printf()| for 
      user-specified precision, up to about 15 significant digits on an Intel PC (I 
      don't know how many on a Mac PPC or an an IBM System-z). 
    - If you can lay hands on (or compile) a Vim patched with Bill McCarthy's 
      additional floating-point functions 
      [http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/web/vim-patches] (#7 in the list), you 
      won't need to know trigonometric formulas for "missing" functions such as 
      tan(), asin(), atan2() etc., and you'll be able to use `acos(-1)` rather than 
      `4*atan(1)` for π, `exp(1)` rather than a literal value for e.

These extra floating point functions will be part of Vim 7.3. They were included in the pre-release on May 21, 2010. JamesVega 18:53, May 21, 2010 (UTC)

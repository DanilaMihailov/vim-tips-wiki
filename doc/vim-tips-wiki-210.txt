==============================================================================

This tip shows techniques to compile or to run `make` for the file in the 
current buffer. This is useful to list any compile errors in the quickfix 
window.

COMPILE WITH GCC                                    *vtw-210-compile-with-gcc*

If you use

>
    set makeprg=gcc\ -o\ %<\ %
<

in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], and your actual file is 
`file.c`, then `:make` will compile `file.c` with the output `file`. (`gcc 
file.c -o file`).

If you use GNU `make` the above change is not required. Instead, simply use 
the following command to compile the current file (you need to save it first):

>
    :make %:r
<

When using other compilers, like Sun `cc`, you can adapt the tip to suit your 
compiler.

INVOKING MAKE                                          *vtw-210-invoking-make*

The following allows you to press F7 (in normal mode) to invoke `make` to 
compile the file in the current buffer. If modified, the file is first saved.

>
    " Save and make current file.o
    function! Make()
      let curr_dir = expand('%:h')
      if curr_dir == ''
        let curr_dir = '.'
      endif
      echo curr_dir
      execute 'lcd ' . curr_dir
      execute 'make %:r.o'
      execute 'lcd -'
    endfunction
    nnoremap <F7> :update<CR>:call Make()<CR>

TO DO
    - I've done a pretty quick clean up. Would someone please reply here with news 
      about whether it actually works (after testing). - "set makeprg=gcc\ -o\ %<\ 
      %" worked with VIM 8.0 on OSX 10.12.16 
    - Need some explanation, including note about (deprecated) `%<`. JohnBeckett

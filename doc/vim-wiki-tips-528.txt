==============================================================================

When searching in Vim, it can be useful to have the text scroll so that the 
line with the next search hit is in the middle of the screen. That's easy with 
the built in commands: type `n` to jump to the next search hit, then `zz` to 
vertically center the line. In addition, the 'scrolloff' option can be used to 
automatically scroll text into view, so that search hits always have some 
"context" lines before and after.

This tip describes 'scrolloff', and shows some mappings to vertically center 
search hits automatically. There is also a script with more features.

SCROLLOFF OPTION                                    *vwt-528-scrolloff-option*

The 'scrolloff' (scroll offset) option determines the minimum number of 
screen lines that you would like above and below the cursor. By default, 
'scrolloff' is `0` which means that you can move the cursor to any line in the 
window without causing scrolling.

The following command scrolls the text so that (when possible) there are 
always at least five lines visible above the cursor, and five lines visible 
below the cursor:

>
    :set scrolloff=5
<

This option applies to all commands, including searching. After entering the 
above command (which can be abbreviated as `:set so=5`), the next search hit 
will have at least five visible lines of text above and below (except when 
near the beginning or the end of the buffer).

Entering `:set so=999` will keep the cursor vertically centered |vwt-182|.

SIMPLE MAPPINGS                                      *vwt-528-simple-mappings*

Following are some useful mappings to make search results appear in the 
middle of the screen:

>
    :nnoremap n nzz
    :nnoremap N Nzz
    :nnoremap * *zz
    :nnoremap # #zz
    :nnoremap g* g*zz
    :nnoremap g# g#zz

SCRIPT                                                        *vwt-528-script*

An alternative to the simple mappings is to use a script that can cycle 
between different states (only `n` and `N` are mapped):
    - Normal – No mappings: search next and search previous work as normal 
      (default). 
    - Scroll hit to middle if not on same page – No scrolling occurs if the next 
      hit is after the first line and before the last line of the window; otherwise, 
      the search hit is scrolled to the middle. 
    - Scroll hit to middle – The search hit is always scrolled to the middle (when 
      possible). 


With the following script in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], 
press F4 to cycle the behavior of `n` and `N`:

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F4> :call <SID>SearchMode()<CR>
    function s:SearchMode()
      if !exists('s:searchmode') || s:searchmode == 0
        echo 'Search next: scroll hit to middle if not on same page'
        nnoremap <silent> n n:call <SID>MaybeMiddle()<CR>
        nnoremap <silent> N N:call <SID>MaybeMiddle()<CR>
        let s:searchmode = 1
      elseif s:searchmode == 1
        echo 'Search next: scroll hit to middle'
        nnoremap n nzz
        nnoremap N Nzz
        let s:searchmode = 2
      else
        echo 'Search next: normal'
        nunmap n
        nunmap N
        let s:searchmode = 0
      endif
    endfunction
    
    " If cursor is in first or last line of window, scroll to middle line.
    function s:MaybeMiddle()
      if winline() == 1 || winline() == winheight(0)
        normal! zz
      endif
    endfunction

CENTERING `:SUBSTITUTE` MATCHES      *vwt-528-centering-`:substitute`-matches*

If you'd like to have the `substitute` command center matches during 
confirmation, you can wrap the command and fiddle with `scrolloff`. For 
example, here's a mapping from <Leader>s that will start a substitution on the 
selected text, starting from the cursor to the end of the file, with 
confirmation, keeping each match centered as you work your way through the 
file:

>
    com! -nargs=* -complete=command ZZWrap let &scrolloff=999 | exec <q-args> | let &so=0
     noremap <Leader>s "sy:ZZWrap .,$s/<C-r>s//gc<Left><Left><Left>

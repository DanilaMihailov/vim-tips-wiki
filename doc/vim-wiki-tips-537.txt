==============================================================================

I like the Windows default behavior (ctrl-c for copy, ctrl-v for paste, etc) 
even when I'm running vim on a unix terminal. However, using mswin doesn't 
give the right "mark block" behavior in the terminal I use (putty). This may 
hold true for other Xterm emulators: the shift-arrows (mark block) don't work 
because shift-arrow sends exactly the same signal as just arrows. I have some 
maps that fix this by assigning some imaps and vmaps to the combination of 
ctrl-arrows.

>
    " make arrow keys work in visual mode
    vmap <Esc>OA k
    vmap <Esc>OB j
    vmap <Esc>OC l
    vmap <Esc>OD h
    " simulate shift-arrows (select block in windows) with control-arrows
    inoremap <Esc>[A <C-O>vk
    vnoremap <Esc>[A k
    inoremap <Esc>[B <C-O>vj
    vnoremap <Esc>[B j
    inoremap <Esc>[C <C-O>vl
    vnoremap <Esc>[C l
    inoremap <Esc>[D <C-O>vh
    vnoremap <Esc>[D h

I have learnt about ":behave" today, although all I wanted is probably:

>
    set keymodel=behave
    set selectmode=key

":behave mswin" might work great, albeit the strange name of it.I have not 
added anything of this to my vimrc yet, but I tend to go with ":behave mswin" 
for now.

==============================================================================

At the top of a source tree, create a tags file by

>
    % ctags -R
<

This assumes Exuberant Ctags [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/]. The -R (or 
--recurse) option tells ctags to recurse into directories.

Then, set the tags option in vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] as:

>
    set tags=tags;
<

The last semicolon is the key here. When Vim tries to locate the 'tags' file, 
it first looks at the current directory, then the parent directory, then the 
parent of the parent, and so on. This setting works nicely with 'set 
autochdir', because then Vim's current directory is the same as the directory 
of the file. If you do not like using 'autochdir' but want the same upward 
search, use:

>
    set tags=./tags;
<

Here, the leading "./" tells Vim to use the directory of the current file 
rather than Vim's working directory.

Regardless of the specific search used, you need the +path_extra feature for 
this tip.

REFERENCES                                                *vwt-804-references*
    - :help |file-searching|, which also gives details about adding "stop 
      directories" to end the upward search 


COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-804-comments*

You can also tag help/man files, and access it from Vim with commands like 
these in vimrc:

>
    au FileType perl set tags^=$DOC/perl/tags
    au FileType cpp set tags^=$DOC/cpp/tags
<

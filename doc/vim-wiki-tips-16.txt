==============================================================================

The "Hit ENTER to continue" prompt is displayed when Vim is about to redraw 
the screen, but there's text on the screen that you might need to read. This 
happens when something is displayed on the status line that is wider than the 
window, and after executing an external command.

To reduce how often you see the "Hit ENTER to continue" prompt, you can 
shorten the messages, increase the space for displaying messages, or even tell 
Vim not to worry about external command output.

To decrease message size, use the 'shortmess' option. Add the following line 
to your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    :set shortmess=a
<

This will use abbreviations for status messages to make lines shorter. (There 
are several other flags for 'shortmess' that can shorten messages even more. 
:help 'shortmess')

To give more space for displaying messages, you can increase the height of 
the command line to 2 or greater:

>
    :set cmdheight=2
<

The default command height is 1. Increasing `cmdheight` will allow more room 
for commands, although it will take some space away from editing.

You can temporarily change the `cmdheight` to display a prompt for example, 
and then revert it to its original value. This way, you won't have to hit 
enter and it won't take space once finished.

Finally, you can use `:silent` to keep external commands from triggering the 
"Hit ENTER" prompt:

>
    :silent !echo Hello
<

If the command generates any output, you may need to manually refresh the 
screen once you return to Vim (by typing Ctrl-L or entering `:redraw!`). If 
you're running a GUI version of Vim, `:silent` may keep you from seeing any 
output from the command at all!To fix the above problem with regular vim, you 
can use a custom command like this one:

>
    command! -nargs=1 Silent
    \   execute 'silent !' . <q-args>
    \ | execute 'redraw!'
<

Use it like a regular command:

>
    :Silent command
<

Or to fix the redraw problems with external grep use:

>
    command! -nargs=+ Silent
    \   execute 'silent <args>'
    \ | redraw!
<

Which you can use like this:

>
    :Silent grep -RIi "Lost words" .
<

To prevent prompt on mappings create mappings using :map <silent>:

>
    :map <silent> <F12> :call Your_function()<cr>
<

    - putting the following setting into your .vimrc settings file works good for 
      eliminating the <Press Enter> message when first bringing up a vim editor to a 
      specific file with a large path.The 't' option chops the beginning portion of 
      file lines, indicating the truncation with a < sign at the point of 
      truncation. > set shortmess=at <Keithel

That option generally doesn't prevent the message.

It's easy to count the total number of words, or the number of occurrences of 
a particular word, and more.

COUNTING NUMBER OF WORDS  *vwt-689-counting-number-of-words*

To count the number of words in the current buffer, press g then Ctrl-g.

To count the number of words in a block, select the block (for example, type 
V5j to select 6 lines) and again press g then Ctrl-g.

The output looks like this:

>
    Selected 6 of 358 Lines; 37 of 2281 Words; 186 of 13426 Bytes
<

If you prefer, you can call an external program using the "%" file name 
expansion. For example, in Unix you could do the following to get the word 
count of the entire file:

>
    :w
    :!wc %
<

The initial :w writes the current file so that the external program can read 
it. An alternative (which does not require saving the buffer to a file), is to 
use the command:

>
    :w !wc
<

The above writes the current buffer to the standard input of the external wc 
program. :help |:write_c|

LIVE WORD COUNT  *vwt-689-live-word-count*

To get a live word count to show up in the vim status bar is a little 
tricky,but you only need to do this once.

You can edit your vimrc file so the word count is always visible in the 
status line.[1]

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/114431/fast-word-count-function-in-vim]

(FIXME: give step-by-step instructions for one or two simple approaches)

Vim allows you to customize your definition of what counts as a "word".For 
example, people using Vim to edit raw HTML pages may want to tweak the 
definitionso only words actually displayed by a web browser are counted as 
words,but none of the formatting tags count as a word.

COUNTING NUMBER OF PRINTED WORDS IN A LATEX DOCUMENT  *vwt-689-counting-number-of-printed-words-in-a-latex-document*

If you LaTeX and you need a printed word count (for a journal paper, etc.), 
wc's output isn't directly useful, since its count includes all markup and 
other non-printed parts of the file. If you LaTeX in Windows, use something 
like detex [http://urchin.earth.li/~tomford/detex/index.html] to strip the 
markup away, leaving the actual text, before piping to wc. Unxutils 
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/] or Cygwin [http://www.cygwin.com/] 
will be of interest to Windows users needing utilities taken for granted by 
*nix users, including wc.

An example mapping to F3 is given below. The current buffer is written to the 
stdin of detex, which writes the detex-ed file to the stdin of wc. If 
something is selected in visual, visual-block, or visual-line mode, only the 
selection is counted, otherwise the entire buffer is counted.

>
    :map <F3> :w !detex \| wc -w<CR>
<

In Windows, this could be made less obtrusive by returning wc's output to a 
discreet error message at the bottom of the buffer or window, rather than 
popping up a console every time. Suggestions are welcome. I was surprised to 
not find anything like this in existing Vim scripts, or packaged with 
vim-latex, which I've used for quite a while. Please replace this section with 
the relevant link if such a thing exists.

EDIT: Texcount Perl script can be also used for this matter, which is quite a 
clever piece of software, but unfortunately, it does not count everything 
perfectly.

COUNTING OCCURRENCES OF A PATTERN  *vwt-689-counting-occurrences-of-a-pattern*

Use the :s substitute command with the n flag (counts number of hits; no 
changes occur) to count the number of occurrences of a pattern. For example:

>
    :%s/pattern//gn
<

Combine this with the ability to Search and replace in a visual selection 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace_in_a_visual_selection], and 
you can count the occurrences in a portion of a file as well!

For example to count space delimited words in a file you could use:

>
    :%s/[^ ]\+//gn
<

A quick way to list all occurrences of the word under the cursor it to type 
[I (which displays each line containing the current keyword, in this file and 
in included files when using a language such as C). :help |[I|

RELATED PLUGINS  *vwt-689-related-plugins*

The WC plugin [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1191] counts 
words according to "Strunk & White" rules, for fiction, novel, or journalism 
writing.

The SearchPosition plugin 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2634] shows the relation to 
search pattern matches in a range or buffer. The mappings, command and 
operator provided by this plugin search a range or the entire buffer for a 
pattern (defaulting to the current search pattern), and print a summary of the 
number of occurrences above, below and on the current line, for example:

>
    1 match after cursor in this line, 8 following, 2 in previous lines; total 10 for /\<SearchPosition\>/
    5 matches in this fold, 9 before, 6 following; total 21 for /endif/
    On sole match in this line, 40 in following lines for /let/
    :144,172 7 matches in this fold for /let/

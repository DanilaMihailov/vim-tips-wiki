==============================================================================

':set nu' enables line-numbering. Before version 7, it also shows in the 
on-line help which is not useful. This autocommand disables it for the help in 
older vim.

COMMENTS                                                     *vtw-33-comments*

This is done by default in vim 7

I find it at least educational. And I would not be as strict for older 
versions. And please sign your comments, John :-) bastl

I think it is entirely too specific. I am not sure how to edit the title but 
a much better title would be Running COmmands Automatically for a Given File 
Type --Ojblass [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Ojblass] 02:06, 31 March 2009

I like the specificity and think it's needed because people google for 
specifics...when a specific problem comes up. However, "Running Commands 
Automatically for a Given File Type" would be an excellent topic to have 
linking off of these specific questions so that the pattern becomes clear. 
This wikia needs to allow cut and paste on the commentary for viewers. --March

Please see Disable beeping#Comments where I just replied that copying text from the tips works well. JohnBeckett 00:51, March 4, 2012 (UTC)

==============================================================================

Gvim has an excellent syntax highlighting for XPM images, but sometimes it's 
useful to view the actual data. This can be achieved by searching for 
everything, type in "/." and all characters will be highlighted and therefore 
the old colouring is lost. To regain the normal highlighting you can search 
for a non-existent sequence, like "/foo".

COMMENTS  *vwt-168-comments*

This requires search highlighting to be turned on, see VimTip14 |vwt-14| (or 
just type :set hlsearch). It should also work with 5.7

==============================================================================

Instead of searching for something nonexistant like /foo, just type :noh (for 
no highlighting)

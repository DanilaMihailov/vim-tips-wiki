==============================================================================

In Windows XP or similar, you can have Vim open a chm (HTML Help) file at a 
specific topic. The following example launches the ASA9 Help file on the CWORD 
at the cursor, or at the visually-selected topic.

>
    nnoremap <C-F1> :silent! !cmd.exe /c start keyhh.exe -\#klink "<C-R><C-W>" "$ASANY9\docs\dbmaen9.chm"<CR><CR>
    vnoremap <C-F1> :<C-U>let old_reg=@"<CR>gvy:silent!!cmd.exe /cstart keyhh.exe -\#klink "<C-R><C-R>"" "$ASANY9\docs\dbmaen9.chm"<CR><CR>:let @"=old_reg<CR>:echo ""<CR>
<

The nnoremap opens the help file using the <CWORD> that the cursor is on.

The vnoremap allows you to visually select a block of text and open the 
search window with that text. It also restores whatever was previously 
visually selected after the launch.

If you use the map repeatedly, the same HTML Help window will be used.

COMMENTS  *vwt-506-comments*

It would be really cool to use this as your keywordprg (:help 'keywordprg').

Unfortunately keywordprg requires that the keyword become the last argument 
to the program. Moreover the keywordprgis run through vimrun which requires 
you to close the command prompt that launch the program manually (the "Press 
any key to close this window" message).

You need to get the latest ncurses package available at 
http://www.sunfreeware.com/ [http://www.sunfreeware.com/] and then configure 
with this option:

>
    --with-tlib=ncurses
<

This will link to ncurses which fully supports the color codes. Then make 
sure your display is exported as a color capable terminal.

Furthermore you should add

>
    export TERM=dtterm
<

to your .profile if you're a bash-user.

I tried this in sun solaris 2.8, but didn't work out.

==============================================================================

I tried type in the line as Vim command, it return error: "E492: Not an 
editor command: --with-tlib=ncuerses."

==============================================================================

This tip didn't work for me either, but i found another solution: setting the 
TERM environment variable to "sun-color" did the trick. What's more, it worked 
only when i did NOT compile with --with-tlib=ncurses (letting it to the 
default automatic detection) because with it vim said my TERM was unknown

==============================================================================

You also need to setup ld to search /usr/local/lib. To do this see man crle. 
Add that in, make distclean, reconfigure, and build.. Note: This is NOT a 
runtime (command line/ vimrc) tip, its a compilation tip.

==============================================================================

Maybe you should "export TERM=xterm-color" in addition to "configure with 
this option: --with-tlib=ncurses ".It works well on my box.

==============================================================================

Here's what works on my Solaris 8/9 boxes:

>
    if &term =~ "xterm"
      if has("terminfo")
        set t_Co=8
        set t_Sf=ESC[3%p1%dm
        set t_Sb=ESC[4%p1%dm
      else
        set t_Co=8
        set t_Sf=ESC[3%dm
        set t_Sb=ESC[4%dm
      endif
    endif
<

==============================================================================

With Solaris 9 Intel x86 edition, after a normal installation, plus the 
package ncurses and vim for Solaris 9 x86 installed

You just need to create a $HOME/.vimrc with:

>
    syntax on
<

In this case you will get colorised syntax in vim, called from a dtterm

On a native xterm you will not get color, because this is a black and white 
xterm.

If you install the binaries and lib of XfreeOrg_XFREE86-4.1.0, (package for 
Solaris Intel from ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.4.0/binaries/Solaris-9/ 
[ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.4.0/binaries/Solaris-9/]) you will get an 
xterm with color like under linux.

Don't try to install all the packages in particular the XFree Driver must be 
the one from Sun, like SUN_XFREE86-4.0.3 or SUN_XFREE86-4.2.0 which include 
package to install with pgdadd, and found in xf86_drv_port_bin_403_2.tar.gz or 
xf86_drv_port_bin_420_1.tar.gz from: 
http://developers.sun.com/solaris/developer/support/driver/tools/video/video-index.html 
[http://developers.sun.com/solaris/developer/support/driver/tools/video/video-index.html] 
--> Download Porting Kit (you will have to register , but its free, before 
download). Any way these packages are not required if the native Solaris X 
driver is fine for your card.

From the ftp.xfree86.org/pub archive, just extract the tarball: Xbin.tgz 
Xdoc.tgz Xlib.tgz Xman.tgz for example, under a new created directory 
/usr/X11R6 if it doesn't exist (created by SUN_XFREE86 when installed), and 
put /usr/X11R6/bin in the PATH , and /usr/X11R6/lib in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, added 
in /etc/profile for example.

Then if you use vim in a /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm, you have also to set 
TERM=xterm-color, then vim works also as fine as in dtterm; unfortunately, 
other command like less will complain about bad implementation because 
xterm-color doesn't exist in /usr/share/lib/terminfo/x; correct the problem by 
copying in this directory the xterm-color f from linux machine (in 
/usr/share/terminfo/x)

==============================================================================

>
    export TERM=xtermc
<

that is what worked for me. Many of the systems at this place are still 
solaris 2.6 though, so I don't know whether this makes a difference, I have 
got to the 9 systems yet.

==============================================================================

'xtermc' worked for me as well, connecting using putty to a solaris 5.7 
system. In my case, it seems clear that vim had already been installed using 
ncurses, but the terminfo was outdated, and the xterm entry doesnt include 
color information or something. The net result for me was bold and underlined 
text, but no real colors.

There is no 'xtermc' in the termcap, which could conceivably cause problems 
for other (less important) shell applications.

==============================================================================

With Putty, set the "Terminal-type string" setting in the "Connection" 
category to "xtermc".

Save your settings, log in, and enjoy the view.

==============================================================================

I tried this:

>
    PuTTY with Terminal-type string to xtermc
    TERM to xtermc
<

and Vim is now working with colours. But, arrows don't work anymore with 
Midnight Commander.

==============================================================================

In Application keypad settings section in the Keyboard-Config in PuTTY:
    - do not check Application cursor keys totally disabled 
    - check Initial state of cursor keys: Application 
    - do bot chech Application keypad keys totally disabled 
    - check Initial state of numeric keypad to Application 


==============================================================================

The effects of terminal type strings in ncurses (and more) are defined by a 
very dense configuration that is part of the "terminfo" system, and "termcap" 
system in some other programs. I think it's probably too far outside the scope 
of this forum, but researching that should serve you well (also i dont know 
enough about it to say anything useful). Be sure not to miss 
http://www.catb.org/~esr/terminfo/ [http://www.catb.org/~esr/terminfo/] - 
could be a valuable resource if you do give it a go.

==============================================================================

solaris 9 - try "TERM=dtterm; export TERM" in an xterm window ... seems to 
work also

==============================================================================

I confirm, 'export TERM=xtermc' enables colors on solaris 2.8 (without 
--with-tlib=ncurses compile option), but does not work on 2.6 system

==============================================================================

'xtermc' worked for me on Solaris 10 (as did 'sun-color', but that one 
limited my view to 60 rows).

==============================================================================

export TERM=xtermc worked for me in Solaris 5.8

==============================================================================

I am on a SUN machine as well and have tried everything in this list, but 
finally I saw a post that said set my TERM to sun-color so I went to my .vimrc 
and places a nice litte

>
    set term=sun-color
    syntax on
<

and it works like a charm! thanks

==============================================================================

>
    set term=xtermc
    syntax on
<

worked like a charm on x86 Solaris 10.

==============================================================================

You can also set in your ~/.profile in Solaris 8 the following

>
    export TERM=ansi
<

then within your ~/.vimrc

>
    syntax on
    set nocp incsearch
    set cinoptions=:0,p0,t0
    set cinwords=if,else,while,do,for,switch,case,def
    set formatoptions=tcqr
    set cindent
    set ruler
<

that should work for most installs with the SunFreeware packages.

==============================================================================

I just built vim 7.0 with no special options or libs and set "export 
TERM=xterm-color" to get color.

==============================================================================

TERM=xterm-color works better for me than TERM=xtermc. Both give color but 
xtermc produces some artifacts when exiting vim.

==============================================================================

Another possible hack is to set an alias for vim in your .bashrc or alike:

>
    alias vim='/usr/bin/env TERM=xterm-color vim'
<

This worked for me and did not produce artifacts when exiting vim.

==============================================================================

I'm using OpenIndiana 10 (forked OpenSolaris 10), and this:

>
    env TERM=xterm-color vim
<

gives me no artifacts but a black-and-white color scheme. xtermc gives color 
but artifacts. The sun-color terminal type works perfectly (color without 
artifacts), but is not recognized on my linux systems, and I'm not able to 
have multiple versions of my .vimrc file. I'm going to have to write some 
conditional code in .vimrc for this. :-(

==============================================================================

On OpenSXCE (sparc version of OpenIndiana) this works perfectly when added to 
the top of my .vimrc:

>
    set term=sun-color
<

Works fine via KDE Konsole SSH session on Fedora 16. No artifacts.

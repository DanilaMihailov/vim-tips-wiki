==============================================================================

Often, you work in a huge code base containing a lot of directories and 
source files (C++, C#, etc) and you want to quickly edit a file. If you know 
at least some part of the file name, you can use this tip to look up the file 
and edit it.

You need some Unix tools such as find, cat, sed and sort. GNU Windows 
versions of these will do as well.

Put the following in a batch file (these examples are for Windows; you can do 
equivalents for Unix):

>
    @find [directory] > c:\files.txt
    @cat c:\files.txt | sed -f c:\tags.sed | sort > c:\files.tags
<

Replace [directory] with whatever directory you want to find the files in. 
For example, c:\root.

Here, c:\tags.sed contains the following:

>
    s/\\/\//g
    s/\(.*\/\)\(.*\)/\2 \1\2 1;" F/g
    s/
    //g
    /.*RECYC.*/d
<

Once, this is done, you simply do the following in your vimrc:

>
    set tags=c:\files.tags
<

That's it! You can now look up and edit any file.

Example: If you have c:\root\Foo.cpp and c:\root\FooBar.cpp and you gave 
c:\root to find tool above, then doing :tj Foo<tab> will give you completion 
for Foo.cpp and FooBar.cpp.

ctags does the same:

>
    ctags -R --file-tags=yes c:/
<

If you want to know how Vim integrates with ctags, check :help |29.1|, :help 
|tagsrch.txt|.

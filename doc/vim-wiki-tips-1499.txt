==============================================================================

Sometimes when a user is spell checking a long document they may 
inadvertently mark a word as correct and jump to the next word using the ]s 
command. If the user had not jumped to the next word, they would be able to 
issue the zug command to mark the word as 'not found'. But, when a user has 
already moved to the next word, they must first move back in the jump list to 
the word they inadvertently marked as 'correct' using the Ctrl-O command. Then 
the user can issue the zug command, marking the word as 'not found' before 
continuing forward.

==============================================================================

A simple alias (*csh) or shell function (bash) will let you run make from 
your shell, then automatically open vim or gvim on the errors (if there were 
any):

csh or tcsh:

>
    alias Make 'make \!* |& tee make.errors || gvim -q make.errors -c :copen'
<

bash:

>
    Make () { command make "$@" |& tee make.errors || gvim -q make.errors -c :copen ; }
<

If you use vanilla sh or ksh or even cmd.exe, you can probably do the same - 
add a note if you have ideas.

The '|&' before the 'tee' doesn't work on Bash version 3.00.15(1)-release. I 
had to take out '&' for it to run.

What does the '&' make the pipe do? Answer: pipes both stdout and stderr.

==============================================================================

Is this somehow better than running make from within Vim using the :make 
command?

I have an alias like this:

>
    alias vmake 'vim -c make! -c cwindow'
<

Much more elegant, in my opinion.

==============================================================================

After added this to ~/.bashrc

>
    Make () {
       make "$@" 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 | tee make.errors
       N=`wc -l make.errors|cut -d ' ' -f 1`
       if [ $N"x" != "0x" ]; then
           vim -q make.errors -c :copen
       fi
    }

Compiling your program, Ex:

>
    #Make clean all
<

If error happened, then vim invokes automatically.

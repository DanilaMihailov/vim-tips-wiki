==============================================================================

I was wondering how I could make an automatic backup of my edited files. I 
added the following to my vimrc:

>
    set backupdir=c:\temp\vim_backup
    let myvar = strftime("(%y%m%d)[%Hh%M]")
    let myvar = "set backupext=_". myvar
    execute myvar
<

So the command which is executed in this example sounds like this:

>
    set backupext=_(050309)[15h15]
<

This creates backups into c:\temp\vim_backup\ having names like 
myfile_(050309)[15h15] instead of myfile~

Each time my vim starts up for editing a file, backupext gets changed so I 
get at least one backup per day, without overwriting backups of the day 
before.

If I open and close that file more often, I could theoretically have one 
Backup each minute. ( But who would want to have that many backups ? )

With the following mapping:

>
    fun! InitBex()
     let myvar = strftime("(%y%m%d)[%Hh%M]")
     let myvar = "set backupext=_". myvar
     execute myvar
     echo myvar
    endfun
    map <Esc> :call InitBex()<CR>
<

You can easily refresh the backupextension time everytime you hit the <Esc> 
key. So you can get backups every minute, every hour, every day and so on.

If having multiple backups interests you, you may also consider script#89 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=89] savevers.vim by Ed 
Ralston or script#563 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=563] 
rcsvers.vim by Juan Frias and Roger Pilkey.

==============================================================================

If you guys need this kind of backup, invest in version control (I recommend 
git).

==============================================================================

You can determine how many backups you get by changing the backupext - 
String: If the backup - String contains minutes, you could get far too many 
backups ( maximum: one per minute ).

If you leave out the minutes, you get maximum one backup per hour. Leave out 
the hours -> one per day ...

We use version control for our standard - Software. But we do customizing, 
too for our customers. And all these customized functions differ from the 
standard. That's why I want a backup without using a CVS Tool

==============================================================================

If you are a sysadmin and trying to fix something, I think you *do* want that 
many backups. The drive space is cheap when compared with the cost of 
unnecesary downtime. I can always send the backups to my trash directory which 
is already managed. For that matter, I can probably set up logrotate to 
compress all of the text files in the users trash directories *and* delete the 
old ones.

==============================================================================

This seems to work for a backup each and every time the file has changed and 
it does so with a correctly dated and absolutely unique filename in the trash 
directory. mktemp gaurrenties uniqueness, if not my spelling. ;-) As for 
knowing when it was deleted, hey that's what we have file attributes for. A 
trash dumping utility would have to go by the file attributes anyway, right? 
So here we go:

>
    set backup
    " in .vimrc right after the text: "
    "if has("autocmd") put this:"
    augroup backups
     au!
    "Note:Sorry, but this all goes on one line"
    autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost * !diff -d <afile> <afile>~ &> /dev/null;if [[ $? == 1 ]];then touch <afile>~;mv <afile>~ `mktemp ~/Desktop/Trash/<afile>.XXXXXX`;fi
    augroup END
<

"Note: If you see something like this, you know it is working:"

>
    "leaves.txt" 182L, 2031C written
    :!diff -d leaves.txt leaves.txt~ &> /dev/null;if [[ $? == 1 ]];then mv leaves.txt~ `mktemp ~/Desktop/Trash/leaves.txt.XXXXXX`;fi
<

OK, now let's discuss what it does:

>
    #This line turns on backups:
    set backup
    
    #This line declares a new auto command group named backups.
    augroup backups
    
    #Erase any extra garbage commands that might be lying around.
     au!
    
    autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost * !diff -d <afile> <afile>~ &> /dev/null;if [[ $? == 1 ]];then touch <afile>~;mv <afile>~ `mktemp ~/Desktop/Trash/<afile>.XXXXXX`;fi
    
    # Of course, this is the end of our one-liner augroup statement.
    augroup END
<

The above says create an new autocmd that will be executed when writing a 
file or buffer is finished. It will apply to files named "*". The bang (i.e. 
"!") identifies the command to be executed which comes next. The command 
itself is nothing more than a few BASH commands all on the same line. <afile> 
is the name of the affected file. Since we know that the name of the backup 
file is always "filename~", we can use <afile>~ to nail the backup file 
immediately after it has been written.

I could have just as easily used a bash script to take care of this. It would 
have been much neater to look at but not as copyable and self contained. The 
script would have looked like this:

>
    #!/bin/bash
    #This script is named trash.sh
    diff -d $1 $2 &> /dev/null
    if [[ $? == 1 ]]
     then touch <afile>~
     mv $2 `mktemp ~/Desktop/Trash/$1.XXXXXX`
    fi
<

If I were to decide to put this script in my command path and use it, my 
autocmd line would have looked like this:

>
    autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost * !trash.sh <afile> <afile>~
<

==============================================================================

I noticed that this doesn't work for vim (gvim) 6.4 and vim 7.0.

With help from others I got it tested and working for gvim 7.0. I assume for 
6.4 it also work, but didn't test it.

The chars '[' and ']' are not working in strftime apparently, and therefore I 
used '{' and '}'

Copy this into your _vimrc:

>
    fun! NewInitBex()
      let &bex = '-' . strftime("(%Y%m%d)-{%H%M}")
    endfun
<

And instead of mapping the ESC char I used:

>
    autocmd BufWritePre * call NewInitBex()
<

==============================================================================

Maybe it works if you escape the [ ] characters:

>
    let &bex = '-' . strftime("(%Y%m%d)-\[%H%M\]")
<

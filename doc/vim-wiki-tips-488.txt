The Vim diff feature (fantastic as it is) opens with the default window width 
(gvim), and the two files each get a half width buffer windows with a vertical 
split between them. When you resize, only one buffer window changes. We might 
write function to automatically center the split and possibly trigger it 
automatically with an autocmd (advanced). However, we can still have Vim open 
with a wider window when performing a diff. The following code can be added to 
the vimrc file. Be sure to adjust the numbers for the available screen 
real-estate and the other settings to taste.

>
    " Window settings
    set lines=60 " Set window height
    set columns=98 " Set window width 'co'
    set guioptions+=b " Add bottom scroll bar 'go'
    " If comparing files side-by-side, then ...
    if &diff
      " double the width up to a reasonable maximum
      let &columns = ((&columns*2 > 172)? 172: &columns*2)
    endif
<

Remember, the default for the columns setting is either 80 or the terminal 
width. I wouldn't expect consistant results for non-gVim usage. By the way, I 
still need to add a test to detect vim vs. gVim in my own vimrc (perhaps 
greping $VIM for gvim) so that I can adjust colors and other settings 
accordingly. Note that the expression in the let statement can be replaced 
with a constant. But, that expression may prove usefull if the columns setting 
is to vary (e.g. a filetype plugin). For a general function (intermediate), 
someone would want to come up with some global names like MaxScreenColumns or 
MaxBufferColumns.

To check if the GUI is enabled, just test with:

>
    if has("gui_running") ... endif
<

Another solution is to put GUI-specific code in your .gvimrc instead, which 
can make stuff a lot cleaner.

==============================================================================

For code that should only be executed when running gvim, wrap it in:

>
    if has("gui")
      " ...
    endif
<

You can also check the availability of options with exists("+guioptions"). 
Note that for exists(), '+' is different then '&'.

==============================================================================

If you want exactly 80 columns in each half:

>
    if &diff
      let &columns = 160 + 2*&foldcolumn + 1
    endif
<

The last 1 is for the vertical separator.

==============================================================================

For win32 users, this will maximize the gvim window and split the two windows 
equally:

>
    if has("gui_running")
      if &diff
        autocmd VimResized * wincmd =
        autocmd GuiEnter * simalt ~x
      endif
    endif
<

"wincmd =" is the same as Ctrl-= and makes split windows equal sized. See 
Maximize or set initial window size 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Maximize_or_set_initial_window_size] for "simalt 
~x". --waywardson

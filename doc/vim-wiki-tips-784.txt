==============================================================================

During editing, there are many situations where one would like to do a 
command based on the word under cursor. Idea is to yank into a register and 
then use this register automatically. Basis of this functionality are two 
commands
    - Yanking into a register, for example: "zyiw - will yank the word into z reg, "byy - yanks the line into b reg
    - Concatenating the register to a command and executing it. :exe "/".@z.""<CR> - searches for string in z reg
    -  Alternately you can replace @z by <C-r>z which will directly replace z by its content. 


Some more examples:

a) Let's say that you have a file that has a list of files. You don't want to 
edit all the files, but selectively.

>
    :map <F2> "zyiw:exe "vs ".@z.""<CR>
<

Pressing <F2> will open the file in vertically split window.

b) Browsing a text file and saving all those difficult words you want to 
refer to during leisure

Open the text file and in a split window open an empty file.

>
    :map <F2> "zyiw<C-w>wo<Esc>"zp<C-w>w
<

yank the word under cursor, change window, paste and return

c) Help in help in help |:help|

>
    :map <F3> "zyiw:exe "h ".@z.""<CR>
<

Press <F3> on any word and we can see vim help for that keyword.

COMMENTS  *vwt-784-comments*

You can use <C-R><C-W> on the ':' command line to paste the word under 
cursor. So, to open a file in a vertically split window:

>
    :vs <C-R><C-W><CR>
<

Alternatively:

>
    :vs <cfile> <CR>
<

Anyway, there are alternatives to some of the examples given:
    - "*": searches the word under cursor
    - "gf": opens the file under the cursor
    - "<C-W>f": same, horizontal split


==============================================================================

Just want to note that your example:

>
    :map <F2> "zyiw<C-w>wo<Esc>"zp<C-w>w
<

works not only with the word under the cursor but with all selected text. 
Very useful for note-taking and so forth.

==============================================================================

You can reload a file using a different encoding if Vim was not able to 
detect the correct encoding:

>
    :e ++enc=<encoding>
<

For example, on Windows in western Europe, the default encoding is latin1. 
However I often use Vim to edit files that must be encoded using the console 
codepage which is is usually cp850 or cp437. So I reload the file using this 
command:

>
    :e ++enc=cp850
<

If you need to do this often, you can map a key to do it for you:

>
    " Press F12 to switch to UTF-8 encoding
    nnoremap <F12> :e ++enc=utf-8<CR>
<

In order for this tip to work, must be set to some value which allows both 
charsets to be represented in memory. For instance to UTF-8, which is the 
default on modern Linux distributions. OTOH, if is set to cp1252, which is the 
default for Windows in "Western" countries, then however you try you won't be 
able to see what a file looks like in some incompatible charset like KOI8-R or 
GB18030. For details, see Working with Unicode

==============================================================================

On Mac OS X systems, you can automatically source Vim sessions by creating an 
Automator Application that forwards the file to Vim with the -S option.

PROCEDURE  *vwt-1645-procedure*
    - Name all your Vim sessions with the same extension, for example ".vis".
    - Open Automator and create a workflow, using File > New.
    - Choose Application as the type for your document.
    - In the Library of Actions, choose Utilities.
    - From the Utilities section, drag the Run Shell Script action.
    - In the Run Shell Script window, choose /bin/bash in Shell pop-up button and as arguments in Pass input pop-up button.
    - Write the script:


>
    source ~/.bash_profile  # necessary to locate mvim
    FILE=$@                 # the session file to open
    FILE=${FILE// /\\ }     # replace spaces with escaped spaces
    mvim -S "$FILE"         # -S open MacVim sourcing the file
<

It is possible to write the script in some other language, but bash is more 
simple.

    - Save the Automator Application in some folder that is already in your path.
    - Set this application as the default app to open Vim session files (borrowed from the Finder Help):


RESULT  *vwt-1645-result*

Whenever you double-click a session file in Finder, will open Vim or MacVim 
sourcing the saved session.It also works using a command line in Terminal: $ 
open test.vis And can be useful when Vim is already running: using netrw 
browser and hitting "x" while cursor is on file name test.vis open a new 
MacVim window with this saved session.

==============================================================================

This tip explains how to cycle between several registers, while accessing 
their content through the standard "unnamed" register (`@"`).

To easily swap between different registers it is convenient to map a key to 
move the registers in a "circular list". The following mapping illustrates the 
idea:

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>s :let @x=@" \| let @"=@a \| let @a=@b \| let @b=@x<CR>
<

Now you can cycle between the registers `""`, `"a`, `"b` by pressing `\s` 
(assuming the default backslash for the leader key).
    - `:let @a=@b` copies register `"b` to register `"a`. 
    - `|` separates Ex commands; `\` escapes the pipe for the map command. 


This is also useful if you want to copy between the xclipboard and the 
unnamed standard register of Vim:

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>s :let @a=@" \| let @"=@+ \| let @+=@a<CR>
<

Another usage can be found in cycling through the cut/copy history, i.e. 
cycling through the numbered registers.

To see what it's changing, you could modify the command like this:

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>s :let @x=@" \| let @"=@a \| let @a=@b \| let @b=@x \| reg "ab<CR>
<

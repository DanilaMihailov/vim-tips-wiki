==============================================================================

Here is how to synchronize your Vim configuration files over many computers 
(your Windows and Linux PCs, your MacBook, your office PC, etc.). Choose one 
of the following approaches and tools:

DROPBOX  *vwt-1637-dropbox*

You can use a Dropbox [http://www.getdropbox.com] account to synchronize your 
configuration files (vimrc or any files) to different computers.

Just move the config files into your ~/Dropbox/ directory (automatically 
created by installation of Dropbox software) and create new config files at 
the original location, containing:

>
    source ~/Dropbox/<configfilename>
<

Now, each change of the config files inside your Dropbox folder will be 
synchronized to all other computers immediately.

UNISON  *vwt-1637-unison*

The Unison File Synchronizer [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/] 
runs on and across Unix and Windows and is free (source code under GNU 
license). It detects changes on each system, and prompts for synchronization 
direction, offers merges, etc. Thus, you can edit your configuration on any 
system and reconcile any conflicts.

If you only have one master system where you make edits, and just want to 
push or pull updates to/from clients, the simpler rsync 
[http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/] tool may be sufficient.

One helpful Vim setting in a mixed-OS environment is to use .vim for Vim user 
settings also for Windows systems (Vim automatically picks up a .vimrc config 
file instead of _vimrc by default). The following snippet in .vimrc will do 
the trick, and thus allow you to synchronize without directory renaming:

>
    " On Windows, also use '.vim' instead of 'vimfiles'; this makes synchronization
    " across (heterogeneous) systems easier.
    if has('win32') || has('win64')
      set runtimepath=$HOME/.vim,$VIM/vimfiles,$VIMRUNTIME,$VIM/vimfiles/after,$HOME/.vim/after
    endif

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM  *vwt-1637-version-control-system*

Some people have put (parts of) their home directory under version control, 
using a version control system like Subversion [http://subversion.tigris.org/] 
or Git [http://git-scm.com/]. Many have also blogged about it, so search the 
web for instructions and reports.With such a setup, you get a (centralized or 
distributed, depending on the system being used) versioned history of your Vim 
configuration, and can use the commands of the version control system (like 
checkout and commit) to update it.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1637-comments*

Amazing. Some brief info on what "synchronize" means would be good (is there 
are a master? is each machine a master? what if conflicts? what if a machine 
is off?). After setup, does the user have to take some specific action apart 
from modifying one of the specified files? JohnBot

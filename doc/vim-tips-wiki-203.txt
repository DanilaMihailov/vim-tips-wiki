ORIGINAL IDEA                                          *vtw-203-original-idea*

Put the following into your vimrc, then use `:Make` instead of `:make`.

>
    " Command Make will call make and then cwindow which
    " opens a 3 line error window if any errors are found.
    " If no errors, it closes any open cwindow.
    :command -nargs=* Make make <args> | cwindow 3
<

Try this mapping so you can just press `\j` to make your program:

>
    :map <Leader>j :Make<CR>
<

You can use the new `:Make` command as an extension point for other 
customizations, too.

AUTOMATICALLY OPEN THE QUICKFIX WINDOW ON :MAKE *vtw-203-automatically-open-the-quickfix-window-on :make*

Starting with Vim 7, there's no need for an additional `:Make` command; 
autocmds can be used to hook into the execution of the quickfix command, and 
open the quickfix window automatically:

>
    " Automatically open, but do not go to (if there are errors) the quickfix /
    " location list window, or close it when is has become empty.
    "
    " Note: Must allow nesting of autocmds to enable any customizations for quickfix
    " buffers.
    " Note: Normally, :cwindow jumps to the quickfix window if the command opens it
    " (but not if it's already open). However, as part of the autocmd, this doesn't
    " seem to happen.
    autocmd QuickFixCmdPost [^l]* nested cwindow
    autocmd QuickFixCmdPost    l* nested lwindow
<

Note that the quickfix window will also automatically close in case the 
quickfix list becomes empty.If instead you always want to open the quickfix 
window, replace the `cwindow` with `copen`.

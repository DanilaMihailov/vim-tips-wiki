==============================================================================

This code fragment is suitable to drop into DrChip's CStubs from script#1269 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1269].

If you have ever wanted to match parts of a word you may have considered 
something like:

>
    if wrd == "re" || wrd == "ret" || wrd == "retu" || wrd == "retur"
      "do something
<

Although the above works well enough it is a pain to maintain and add new 
words (not to mention it's just a touch messy).

A more elegant (and easier to use I believe) method would be to use \%[] as 
part of a pattern.

For instance, "\\<re\\%[tur]\\>" will match "re", "ret", "retu" or "retur"

Explanation:

>
    \\< = start of word
    re = first letters of word we want to require to match
    \\%[tur] = optionally match chars between the braces, i.e. 't', 'tu' or 'tur'
    \\> = end of word
<

So, we can use this as a pattern for match like so (in DrChip's CStubs):

>
    elseif match(wrd, "\\<re\\%[tur]\\>") > -1
      exe "norm! bdWireturn\<Esc>"
<

Which, I think, is a little better than the longer alternative:

>
    " vs
    elseif wrd == "re" || wrd == "ret" || wrd == "retu" || wrd == "retur"
      exe "norm! bdWireturn\<Esc>"
<

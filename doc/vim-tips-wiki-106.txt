==============================================================================

By adding the following line to your `vimrc`, you can use a simple email 
signature rotator:

>
    map <Leader>ms :e c:\sign.txt<CR>ggV/^--  $<CR>k"*xG$a<C-R><C-O>*<Esc>:w<CR>:bd<CR>G$a<C-M><Esc>"*P
<

This rotator expects the user to have a file at the location `C:/sign.txt` 
with the following information:

>
    --
    first signature
    --
    second signature
    --
    third signature
    --
<

When a user finishes an email, they may call the shortcut `\ms` and the 
'first signature' will be inserted into the email. This will also push the 
first signature in `C:\sign.txt` to the end of the file. To change to a 
different signature from the one which is next in the file type `u` and `\ms` 
again.

The `sign.txt` file must employ a signature separator like the following: '-- 
'.

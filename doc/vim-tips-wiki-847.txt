When you open a file opened in somewhere else, you would get "E325: 
ATTENTION" message because a swap file already exists there. I (almost) always 
choose the action "[O]pen Read-Only" in this case, so typing 'O' key is an 
annoying job for me. The following in my vimrc reduce my job.

    func CheckSwap()
      swapname
      if v:statusmsg =~ '\.sw[^p]$'
        set ro
      endif
    endfunc
    
    if &swf
      set shm+=A
      au BufReadPre * call CheckSwap()
    endif

Very neat trick. However, in a genuine case (when a previous session really 
crashed), the message is still usefull, and avoiding it could cause some 
confusion later. Also, you might want to recover the file immediately too. To 
address this issue, here is a modified attempt that echoes a message in this 
case. The message is hopefully easier to digest than the original ATTENTION 
dialog.

I improved it slighly more with a toggle option. If you want to delete the 
swapfile, it is easier to have Vim do it, so I added a ToggleSwapCheck() 
function. I usage is to toggle the behavior, reload the buffer to get the Vim 
dialog box where you can choose to delete the swap. You can later toggle it 
back on by calling the same function.

        let &shm = s:_shm

      aug CheckSwap
        au!
        if s:swapCheckEnabled
          set shm+=A
          au BufReadPre * call CheckSwapFile()
          au BufRead * call WarnSwapFile()
        endif
      aug END
    endfunction
    call ToggleSwapCheck()
    
    function! CheckSwapFile()
      if !exists('*GetVimCmdOutput') || !&swapfile || !s:swapCheckEnabled
        return
      endif
    
      let swapname = GetVimCmdOutput('swapname')
      if swapname =~ '\.sw[^p]$'
        set ro
        let b:_warnSwap = 1
      endif
    endfunction
    
    function! WarnSwapFile()
      if exists('b:_warnSwap') && b:_warnSwap && &swapfile
        echohl ErrorMsg | echomsg "File: \"" . bufname('%') .
         \ "\" is opened readonly, as a swapfile already existed."
         \ | echohl NONE
        unlet b:_warnSwap
      endif
    endfunction

==============================================================================

Map a key to make the current window as large as possible (without closing 
other windows):

>
    map <F5> <C-W>_<C-W><Bar>
<

If you don't mind closing other windows, you can make the current window even 
larger:

>
    :only
<

Or you can use CTRL-W o (or CTRL-W CTRL-O), which does the same thing as 
`:only` in even fewer keystrokes.

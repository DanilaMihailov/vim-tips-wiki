==============================================================================

Vim provides many ways to move the cursor. Becoming familiar with them leads 
to more effective text editing.

>
    h   move one character left
    j   move one row down
    k   move one row up
    l   move one character right
    w   move to beginning of next word
    b   move to previous beginning of word
    e   move to end of word
    W   move to beginning of next word after a whitespace
    B   move to beginning of previous word before a whitespace
    E   move to end of word before a whitespace
<

All the above movements can be preceded by a count; e.g. `4j` moves down 4 
lines.

>
    0   move to beginning of line
    $   move to end of line
    _   move to first non-blank character of the line
    g_  move to last non-blank character of the line
    
    gg  move to first line
    G   move to last line
<

>
    ngg move to n'th line of file (n is a number; 12gg moves to line 12)
    nG  move to n'th line of file (n is a number; 12G moves to line 12)
<

    H   move to top of screen

    zz  scroll the line with the cursor to the center of the screen
    zt  scroll the line with the cursor to the top
    zb  scroll the line with the cursor to the bottom
    
    Ctrl-D  move half-page down
    Ctrl-U  move half-page up
    Ctrl-B  page up
    Ctrl-F  page down
    Ctrl-O  jump to last (older) cursor position
    Ctrl-I  jump to next cursor position (after Ctrl-O)
    Ctrl-Y  move view pane up
    Ctrl-E  move view pane down
    
    n   next matching search pattern
    N   previous matching search pattern
    *   next whole word under cursor
    #   previous whole word under cursor
    g*  next matching search (not whole word) pattern under cursor
    g#  previous matching search (not whole word) pattern under cursor
    gd  go to definition/first occurrence of the word under cursor
<

    %   jump to matching bracket { } [ ] ( )
    
    fX  to next 'X' after cursor, in the same line (X is any character)
    FX  to previous 'X' before cursor (f and F put the cursor on X)
    tX  til next 'X' (similar to above, but cursor is before X)
    TX  til previous 'X'
    ;   repeat above, in same direction
    ,   repeat above, in reverse direction

See `:help {command}` (for example, :help |g_|) for all of the above if you 
want more details.

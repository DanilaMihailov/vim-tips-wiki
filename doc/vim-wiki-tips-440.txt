==============================================================================

When editing a plain-text file (not a program) it can be useful to have lines 
automatically broken when a certain length is reached. For example, the 
following command sets the current buffer so that lines longer than 60 
characters are broken (a newline is automatically inserted):

>
    :setlocal textwidth=60
    " Following (using abbreviations) is equivalent.
    :setl tw=60

FORMATTING A PARAGRAPH  *vwt-440-formatting-a-paragraph*

You may edit a paragraph consisting of several lines. When finished editing, 
some lines may be shorter than required. To fix this, in normal mode, type 
gqip to format the "inner paragraph". In this context, "format" means to 
reflow the paragraph so that all lines are the optimal length.

Alternatively, format options can be set so that a paragraph is reflowed 
automatically, after each change. :help |auto-format|

An example setting for formatoptions (fo) is:

>
    :setl fo=aw2tq
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-440-comments*

TO DO
    - Explain what above fo does, and how to configure so paragraphs do not have the first line indented, and are separated by a blank line.
    - Discuss :setl fo+=a and :setl fo-=a.
    - Incorporate following comments.
    - For CJK/Asian language, :set fo+=m will break line at double width chars too.


==============================================================================

Sometimes it is useful to keep each paragraph as one long line (that is, do 
not break the paragraph into lines). See these related tips:
    - 38 Move cursor by display lines when wrapping |vwt-38|
    - 989 Word wrap without line breaks |vwt-989|


The following sets the current buffer so that long lines are automatically 
wrapped on the screen, with lines only breaking at a space. The mappings move 
the cursor up/down by screen lines instead of by file lines. There is a space 
following the backslash for the 'breakat' option (the set command requires a 
backslash before each space). Each long line will be displayed on the screen 
as multiple lines.

>
    setlocal wrap nolist linebreak breakat=\ 
    nnoremap j gj
    nnoremap k gk
    vnoremap j gj
    vnoremap k gk

==============================================================================

Automatically inserting line breaks is a disaster when editing programs, but 
is very good for editing a text file. With the following in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], the settings will only be applied to 
*.txt files:

>
    au BufEnter *.txt setl tx ts=4 sw=4 fo+=n2a
<

==============================================================================

If you make a change to a wrapped paragraph and need to re-format it, you can 
use gq followed by a movement over the area you want to re-format, e.g. 3j or 
}.

Automatic text wrapping and re-formatting with gq can work on comments lines 
also, provided the value of the 'comments' option is set correctly.

==============================================================================

I am using PuTTY in Windows to access a Unix box, and the Terminal-type 
string in PuTTY is set to xterm. I wanted to use Vim's color schemes. I tried 
many different things with no decent result until I found the following code 
in Vim's help. After inserting the following lines in my vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], I was able to use all the color schemes 
defined by Vim.

For a 16-color display:

>
    if has("terminfo")
      let &t_Co=16
      let &t_AB="\<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{92}%+%;%dm"
      let &t_AF="\<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{82}%+%;%dm"
    else
      let &t_Co=16
      let &t_Sf="\<Esc>[3%dm"
      let &t_Sb="\<Esc>[4%dm"
    endif
<

:help |xfree-xterm|

For an 8-color display:

>
    if &term =~ "xterm"
      if has("terminfo")
        let &t_Co=8
        let &t_Sf="\<Esc>[3%p1%dm"
        let &t_Sb="\<Esc>[4%p1%dm"
      else
        let &t_Co=8
        let &t_Sf="\<Esc>[3%dm"
        let &t_Sb="\<Esc>[4%dm"
      endif
    endif
<

ALTERNATIVE                                             *vwt-1576-alternative*

With the settings below, using `:runtime syntax/colortest.vim` shows all 23 
colors as distinctly unique.

Putty settings: Window, Colours

[x] Allow terminal to specify ANSI colours
[x] Allow terminal to specify xterm 256-colour mode
[x] Bolded text is a different colour

Settings in vimrc:

>
    if &term =~ "xterm"
      " 256 colors
      let &t_Co = 256
      " restore screen after quitting
      let &t_ti = "\<Esc>7\<Esc>[r\<Esc>[?47h"
      let &t_te = "\<Esc>[?47l\<Esc>8"
      if has("terminfo")
        let &t_Sf = "\<Esc>[3%p1%dm"
        let &t_Sb = "\<Esc>[4%p1%dm"
      else
        let &t_Sf = "\<Esc>[3%dm"
        let &t_Sb = "\<Esc>[4%dm"
      endif
    endif
<

It is relatively easy to change the TERM setting PuTTY uses to set it to send 
it as "xterm-256color" (or install the full set of terminfo files and set it 
to the proper setting of "putty-256color". -- PuTTY doesn't support Techtronix 
mode and so is not fully xterm compatible.)

In PuTTY this is changed in the Configuration in the Connection -> Data 
section. This is the same preferences page where you specify your auto-login 
username, so you should be visiting this page anyway. With your auto-login 
username specified, and public key authorization (which you should be using) 
and a key agent running (PuTTY's Pageant does this) you can select a host and 
log in without being prompted for username or password.

With your TERM set to anything close to accurate, you can then leverage all 
256 colors in other applications without manually tweaking the settings for 
every application.

==============================================================================

I often use PuTTY at work to connect to a solaris box which we use for 
compiling code. I have no admin rights, and no knowledge of how to set up 
terminfo, etc. I tried the PuTTY setting you give, but I just get a "using 
dumb terminal mode" message on login, and Vim has no colors. The 256-color 
workaround in this tip works fine. I don't like it, I'd rather do it "the 
right way" but sadly this may not be an option for me. Unless there's 
something I can do in my own user space to get the terminfo correct.

Chances are your system doesn't use terminfo then. Try hardwiring your term 
option like this:

set term=builtin_xterm

or

set term=builtin_ansi

That should give you colors in putty. Your vim needs to be compiled with 
+builtin_term (+ or ++), though.

Thanks for the suggestion. I have +builtin_terms (not ++builtin_terms) but 
neither :set term=builtin_xterm nor :set term=builtin_ansi have any noticeable 
effect to enable colors, even when it is the first item in the .vimrc (after 
:set nocompatible). Since the hack in this tip does work for me, and I really 
don't know much about terminal configuration, I'm probably going to just leave 
it. --Fritzophrenic [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Fritzophrenic] 14:24,

It works for me with putty. But I need to explicitly set :syntax on after setting 'term' to builtin_ansi. 217.88.63.38 13:20, December 11, 2010 (UTC)

Try to set Terminal-type string in putty (Connection->Data) to 
'putty-256color'. That worked for me.

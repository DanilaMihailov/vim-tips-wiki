This tip shows how to use Vim to view the text in a PDF document. That can be 
useful to use Vim to see the differences between the text in two versions of a 
pdf. You need to install xpdf [http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/] (available on all 
major platforms) as it provides the pdftotext utility to read the text from a 
pdf file.

PROCEDURE  *vwt-1356-procedure*

Put one of the following mappings in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    :command! -complete=file -nargs=1 Rpdf :r !pdftotext -nopgbrk <q-args> -
    :command! -complete=file -nargs=1 Rpdf :r !pdftotext -nopgbrk <q-args> - |fmt -csw78
<

These define the :Rpdf command to read the result of converting a pdf 
document to text. The text is read into the current buffer after the current 
line. The first reads the pdf with each paragraph as a long line, while the 
second wraps long lines (if the fmt utility is available).

For example, the following commands open a new tab page and read the text 
from a pdf document into the buffer.

>
    :tabnew
    :Rpdf example.pdf

You could create a ftdetect plugin and put instruction in it so you can just 
:edit filename.pdf and it'll set options for it. :help |new-filetype|

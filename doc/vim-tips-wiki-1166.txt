==============================================================================

Vim has a very powerful built-in sort utility, or it can interface with an 
external one. In order to keep only unique lines in Vim, you would:

>
    :{range}sort u
<

Yes, it's that simple.

You could create a range in advance, such as 'a,. (from mark 'a' to the 
current line) or you could create one on-the-fly using visual selection by 
pressing ':' in visual mode, after selecting the text you wish to sort, to get 
a range of '<,'> on the command line.

If you like using an external sort utility instead, you can do it just as 
easily. For example, Unix sort, removing duplicate lines:

>
    :{range}!sort -u
<

Many other systems also have an external sort utility, but the options and 
capabilities will differ. It is probably better to use the built-in Vim sort 
unless you are looking for a specific feature of the external sort (or using 
an old Vim without the `:sort` command).

EXAMPLES                                                   *vtw-1166-examples*

SORT IN REVERSE                                     *vtw-1166-sort-in-reverse*

>
    :%sort!
<

SORT, REMOVING DUPLICATE LINES       *vtw-1166-sort,-removing-duplicate-lines*

>
    :%sort u
<

SORT USING THE EXTERNAL UNIX SORT UTILITY, RESPECTING MONTH-NAME ORDER *vtw-1166-sort-using-the-external-unix-sort-utility,-respecting-month-name-order*

>
    :%!sort -M
<

("respecting month-name order" means January < February < ... < December)

NUMERIC SORT                                           *vtw-1166-numeric-sort*

>
    :sort n
<

(this way, 100 doesn't precede 20 in the sort)

SORT SUBSECTIONS INDEPENDENTLY, IN THIS EXAMPLE SORT NUMBERS BETWEEN START AND END MARKERS *vtw-1166-sort-subsections-independently,-in-this-example-sort-numbers-between-start-and-end-markers*

>
    :g/start/+1,/end/-1 sort n
<

SORT ONLY SPECIFIC LINES USING RANGES *vtw-1166-sort-only-specific-lines-using-ranges*

sort lines 296 to 349, inclusive

>
    :296,349sort
<

SORT BY PATTERN                                     *vtw-1166-sort-by-pattern*

When working with Javascript ES6, it may be useful to sort your imports

>
    import './ProjectTemplateEditModal.scss';
    import * as _ from "lodash";
    import Moment from 'moment';
    import React from 'react';
    import { Button, Col, Modal, Row, Label } from 'react-bootstrap';
    import { CurrencyControl } from '../../Core/Components/Controls';
    import { DynamicModalMixin } from '../../Core/Components/Modals';
    import { ProjectTemplateStore } from '../Stores/ProjectTemplateStore';
    import { StoreBinder } from '../../Core/Utils/StoreBinder';
    import { TextAreaControl } from '../../Core/Components/Controls/TextAreaControl';
    import { TextBoxControl } from '../../Core/Components/Controls/TextBoxControl';
    import { TooltipWrapper } from '../../Core/Components/Tooltips/TooltipWrapper';
    import { withRouter } from 'react-router';
<It is possible to pass a regex expression to sort. Any lines that do not match the expression will be sorted normally, while lines that do match will be sorted on the text that *follows* the expression. 

>
    :{range}sort /\/[A-z]/
< This will organize your imports relative to the "package" they are related to:

>
    import * as _ from "lodash";
    import Moment from 'moment';
    import React from 'react';
    import { Button, Col, Modal, Row, Label } from 'react-bootstrap';
    import { withRouter } from 'react-router';
    import { CurrencyControl } from '../../Core/Components/Controls';
    import { TextAreaControl } from '../../Core/Components/Controls/TextAreaControl';
    import { TextBoxControl } from '../../Core/Components/Controls/TextBoxControl';
    import { DynamicModalMixin } from '../../Core/Components/Modals';
    import { TooltipWrapper } from '../../Core/Components/Tooltips/TooltipWrapper';
    import { StoreBinder } from '../../Core/Utils/StoreBinder';
    import './ProjectTemplateEditModal.scss';
    import { ProjectTemplateStore } from '../Stores/ProjectTemplateStore';
<You can also sort on text that *matches* the regex by including the 'r' flag, for example:  

>
    :{range}sort /\/[A-z]/ r
<

TO DO
    - Probably need some general `:sort` command info. 
    - Give examples of numeric sort and using regex sort. 
    - Clean up my "see also" list. It's useful now for a comprehensive list of 
      related tips, some of which need work. At least should add a note on point of 
      tip. 
    - If we're going to mention an external sort tool, we may as well include the 
      following with a brief explanation. Vim could do this, but only with a complex 
      regex. Or perhaps better, mention it in VimTip374 |vtw-374| or VimTip923 
      |vtw-923| in "see also". `-k2` sorts on the second field (word by default).

    :!sort -k2

==============================================================================

This misguided snippet was added recently:

delimit the column using some char here I have | symbol as delimiter, once did with that you can use below command to sort specific column use -n if u want to sort numeric and its working on some version of vi and not on ubuntu vi :(

>
    /|.*|/ | sort
<

used to match a patern |.*| used to match words delimited between || and | as piping commend and sort to sort

This is wrong and should never work. Here's what it is actually doing:

`/|.*|/`: jump to the next line that has two '|' characters in it, anywhere

`|`: command separator, this lets you start a new command on the current line

`sort`: do a default sort of the entire buffer

Basically this is the equivalent of typing `:%sort`.

Now, what you CAN do, is provide a pattern that the `:sort` command will skip 
over and ignore at the start of every line while sorting. For example, to sort 
based only on text after the last '|' character on the line (what I think was 
intended by the example), you'd do this:

>
    :sort /^.*|/
<

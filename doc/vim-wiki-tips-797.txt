==============================================================================

When you set foldmethod to something like indent or syntax, which defines 
folds as soon as you open the file, all folds are closed by default. If you 
set the foldlevel to a high setting, files are always loaded with opened 
folds. For example, you could put the settings below in your vimrc:

>
    set foldmethod=indent
    set foldlevel=20
<

This is not ideal, however, as the foldlevel option is local to the window, 
and additionally gets modified every time you use a command that adjusts the 
fold level, like zm, zr, and their friends.

A better method is to set the foldlevel whenever you load a buffer into a 
window. You could use autocommands for this, but there is a built-in option 
that does this for you automatically:

>
    set foldlevelstart=20
<

This is much closer to an optimal solution, but one problem remains: even 
with the foldlevelstart option, it will take several iterations of the zm 
command to hide any of a file if you have set the foldlevel high enough. To 
fix this, you need to use autocmds. For example, to open all folds for a list 
of file types, but only up to the maximum fold level so that zm and related 
commands work right away, you could do the following:

>
    " Note, perl automatically sets foldmethod in the syntax file
    autocmd Syntax c,cpp,vim,xml,html,xhtml setlocal foldmethod=syntax
    autocmd Syntax c,cpp,vim,xml,html,xhtml,perl normal zR
<

Tweak the event and filetypes matched to your liking.

You could use a combination of this method and the foldlevelstart option to 
get just enough fold levels open on certain filetypes, but default to having 
them all open for files which are not of one of your chosen types.

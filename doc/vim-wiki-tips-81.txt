==============================================================================

The `s` (substitute) command can be used to replace specified characters, and 
the `S` command can be used to replace specified lines.

For example, the following has the same leading string on several lines:

>
    foo_bar_baz1 = a1
    foo_bar_baz2 = a2
    foo_bar_baz3 = a3
    foo_bar_baz4 = a4
    foo_bar_baz5 = a5
    foo_bar_baz6 = a6
<

Put the cursor on the `f` at the start of the first line and type the 
following: `7s` then `fixed` then press Esc. That changes `foo_bar_baz1` to 
`fixed_baz1`. Move the cursor to the start of the next line and press `.` to 
repeat the command.

A single character can be replaced with the `r` command. For example, with 
the cursor on "f", type `rt` to replace the "f" with "t". That only works with 
characters that can be entered with a single key press, and `s` can be used to 
for a replacement with a digraph. For example, put the cursor on the "x" in 
text "12x10" then press `s` followed by Ctrl-K `*X` to change the text to 
"12×10".

If you need to substitute three lines of text, type `3S`. Vim deletes the 
three lines and enters insert mode, waiting for the subsitution text.

COMMENTS                                                     *vwt-81-comments*

Of course, if you're lazy like me and you don't want to count that there are 
7 characters that you want to replace, you could use the c command and use a 
motion to specify how much to kill. For example, in the previous example, I'd 
type c2t_ to kill foo_bar and to be left in insert mode.

==============================================================================

You could select the "foo_bar" characters with Ctrl+V (Visual Block – Ctrl+Q 
on Windows), press "c" to change the block, make your change to the first 
line, and press Esc. All the lines you selected will be changed the same way.

==============================================================================

I rely on this behavior so much, I'm always surprised when I use Vim on a 
system that doesn't have this map installed:

>
    nmap . .`[
<

This changes the behavior of the very useful . command to leave the cursor at 
the point where it was before editing started. This means that if I have, say, 
a list of files from a change summary that look like this:

>
    .../foo/bar/pick.c
    .../cram/bar/yup.c
    .../drop/bar/slop.c
<

And I want to change the leading path, I can go to the first one, and type 
(say) c3t/anotherdir<Esc> This gives me:

>
    anotherdir/pick.c
    .../cram/bar/yup.c
    .../drop/bar/slop.c
<

Now I can just go the beginning of the second line and hit `.j.` to change 
the second and third lines. Of course you could also use a regexp for stuff 
like this, but often . is a little faster and saves precious brain cells. See 
:help |.|.

I like that tip. I made something similar to the .

>
    :map <a-.> <Down>.
<

knowing this tip I will change it to

>
    :map <a-.> `[<Down>.
<

So you can do changes in more than one line with repeating only one key.

Sometimes it is useful to make changes like this with a Visual Block, but in 
this example, shown in the tip, it doesn't work. See :help |v_b_I| :help 
|v_b_A|.

==============================================================================

I use this to make changes to a visual block:

>
    vnoremap <silent> . :normal .<CR>
<

If you do something like this on a line:

>
    Aline ending<Esc>
<

(Basically, adding 'line ending' to the end of the line.)

You can then visually select a bunch of lines and hit . to have the same 
happen to each of them.

==============================================================================

There is a very useful feature of Vim built it for doing these kinds of 
edits. Take the original example for instance:

>
    .../foo/bar/pick.c
    .../cram/bar/yup.c
    .../drop/bar/slop.c
<

Instead of changing the first one and repeating the change for the other 
lines...

Visually select the desired text using ctrl-v. Then with them visually 
selected (in this case the leading .'s would be selected) press c and then 
type the new text. It will appear to only be changing the first line however 
once you hit escape it will apply the change to all the lines.

No extra commands and no remapping needed. Works everywhere.

For a better description of all the things you can do with the visual block 
stuff, see :help |blockwise-operators|.

==============================================================================

This throws E19 if you do

>
    :exe "normal d\<Up>G."
<

and it changes the jumplist.

Here are some changes that fix both:

>
    nnoremap <expr> . line(".") == line("$") ? "." : ".g`["

EDIT: Actually, I was anticipating the position after "."

Here's the true solution:

>
    function! ResDot(count)
        execute "normal!" count . "."
        if line("'[") <= line("$")
            normal! g`[
        endif
    endfunction
    
    nnoremap <silent> . :<C-U>call ResDot(v:count1)<CR>
<

TO SET THE INITIAL SIZE OF THE VIM WINDOW *vwt-88-to-set-the-initial-size-of-the-vim-window*

Place the following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] to 
control the initial size of the Vim or gvim window (change the numbers to what 
you need):

>
    set lines=50 columns=1000
<

Here is a more sophisticated version:

>
    if has("gui_running")
      " GUI is running or is about to start.
      " Maximize gvim window (for an alternative on Windows, see simalt below).
      set lines=999 columns=999
    else
      " This is console Vim.
      if exists("+lines")
        set lines=50
      endif
      if exists("+columns")
        set columns=100
      endif
    endif
<

On Linux/bsd's terminal, this is done automatically. If you want to set the 
initial size of gvim, you can put set lines=N columns=N in .gvimrc. Some 
systems support -geometry as shown in the following example. :help |-geometry|

>
    gvim -geometry 97x46+1913+145

TO MAXIMIZE THE INITIAL GVIM WINDOW USING WMCTRL (X SERVER) *vwt-88-to-maximize-the-initial-gvim-window-using-wmctrl-(x-server)*

Instead of running gvim directly, you can run the following simple script:

>
    #!/bin/bash
    exec=/usr/bin/gvim #here you can modify the location of gvim
    $exec -f $* &
    pid=$!
    winid=""
    while [ -z $winid ]; do
      sleep 0.05
      winid=`wmctrl -pl |grep -P "^0x[0-9a-f]+[ ]+[-0-9]+[ ]+$pid" | cut -f1 -d' '`
    done
    # echo "debug: $exec started, PID=$pid, Window ID=$winid"
    #this maximizes the gvim window
    wmctrl -i -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz -r $winid
    #this switches the gvim window to fullscreen
    wmctrl -i -b add,fullscreen -r $winid
<

In words, the script starts gvim, saves its process id and using wmctrl finds 
the window id of gvim. After that, it sends either a command for maximizing 
and/or for fullscreen.

If you want to have this as the default whenever you call gvim, you can, 
e.g., save this script as /usr/local/bin/gvim .

TO MAXIMIZE THE INITIAL VIM WINDOW UNDER WINDOWS *vwt-88-to-maximize-the-initial-vim-window-under-windows*

On some Windows systems, pressing Win-Up (Windows key and the Up cursor key) 
maximizes the window, and Win-Down restores it.

Put the following in your vimrc to maximize Vim on startup (from :help 
|win16-maximized|):

>
    " Use ~x on an English Windows version or ~n for French.
    au GUIEnter * simalt ~x
<

To run a single session of Vim maximized use:

>
    gvim -c 'simalt ~x'
<

A Windows alternative would be to change the properties of the shortcut to 
start Vim, for example:

>
    cmd /c start /max "C:\Program Files\vim\vim71\gvim.exe"
<

This will not work, however, if you disable the menu with guioptions-=m and 
this is not usable if you need to specify gvim as configuration option of some 
third party tools (file managers etc).

There is also a plugin with a DLL to maximize/restore the Vim window: 
maximize.dll: Maximizing plugin for Win32 gvim 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1302].

Nircmd [http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html] is a small tool from 
Nirsoft that can be used to automate various aspects of Windows environment. 
You can use it to start application maximized or maximize running application 
window:

>
    nircmd.exe exec max "C:\Program Files (x86)\vim\vim74\gvim.exe"
<

or as PowerShell function that accepts file argument

>
    function gvim($file) {
      start nircmd.exe "exec max ""C:\Program Files (x86)\vim\vim74\gvim.exe"" $file"
    }
<

TO MAXIMIZE THE INITIAL VIM WINDOW UNDER SAWFISH *vwt-88-to-maximize-the-initial-vim-window-under-sawfish*

You can configure Sawfish [//sawfish.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page] to 
automatically maximize gvim on startup:
    - Run "sawfish-ui". 
    - Select "matched windows", "Add...". 
    - In "macthers" select "Class". 
    - "Grab..." and click the gvim window. 
    - Select the "Maximized" checkbox and click "OK".

EDIT JUNE 9, 2014                                   *vwt-88-edit-june-9,-2014*

An edit put simalt ~x in the "more sophisticated" script, but that is already 
in the tip so I removed it. JohnBeckett

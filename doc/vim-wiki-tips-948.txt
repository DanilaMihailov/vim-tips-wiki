==============================================================================

I frequently get email from people who do not use format-flowed email 
properly. I prefer to send out "correct" email, including the stuff I'm 
quoting, and Vim helps me do that. I added this function to my vimrc, and now 
I use it when editing mail by simply typing:



Fixq



Here's the function:

>
    function! Fixflowed()
      " save cursor position
      let pos = getpos(".")
      " add spaces to the end of every line
      silent! %s/\([^]> :]\)\ze\n>[> ]*[^> ]/\1 /g
      " remove extraneous spaces
      silent! %s/ \+\ze\n[> ]*$//
      " make sure there's only ONE space at the end of each line
      silent! %s/ \{2,}$/ /
      " fix the wockas spacing from the text
      silent! %s/^[> ]*>\ze[^> ]/& /
      " compress the wockas
      while search('^>\+ >', 'w') > 0
        s/^>\+\zs >/>/
      endwhile
      " restore the original cursor location
      call setpos('.',pos)
    endfunction
<

It's a little sensitive because it CAN blow away ascii art (it tries not to), 
and it also doesn't automatically reflow paragraphs (I have no idea how to do 
that properly).

I also have another function that helps when inserting indented paragraphs 
into a format=flowed email; the idea is to remove spaces at the end of 
indented lines so that they won't be wrapped (quoting is not indenting):

>
    function! Fixindented()
      " remove spaces at end of indented lines
      silent! %s/^\s.*\zs \+$//
    endfunction
<

I set these functions up like this:

>
    autocmd Filetype mail command! Fixq call Fixflowed()
    autocmd Filetype mail autocmd BufWritePre <buffer> call Fixindented()
<

Hope it helps someone.

PAR is a lot better at this kind of thing: http://www.nicemice.net/par/ 
[http://www.nicemice.net/par/]

==============================================================================

PAR is a useful tool, but is not specific to format=flowed, and so can be 
over-zealous in some cases. For example, it doesn't recognized the -- 
separator between email body and signature, and wraps it into the signature.

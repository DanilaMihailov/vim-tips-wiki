==============================================================================

The omni complete [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Omni_completion] feature in 
Vim is great. Here are some suggestions for working with the popup completion 
menu.

SETTING THE COLOR                                 *vtw-1486-setting-the-color*

Try the following command to improve the color of the popup menu (add to your 
vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] if you always want this choice):

>
    :highlight Pmenu guibg=brown gui=bold
<

In console Vim, you might want a command like this:

>
    :highlight Pmenu ctermbg=238 gui=bold
<

To see how different color schemes look, try (see view all colors |vtw-634|):

>
    :runtime syntax/colortest.vim
<

Better still would be to use a color scheme that is designed with the 
completion menu in mind. For example, marklar.vim Dark colorscheme based on 
green chalkboard [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1483].

USING SUPERTAB                                       *vtw-1486-using-supertab*

The SuperTab [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643] plugin 
can be used to avoid needing to press Ctrl-X then Ctrl-O to invoke the popup 
completion menu. With SuperTab installed, the following setting means you can 
just press Tab instead.

>
    let g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = "<C-X><C-O>"
<

You may also try the context value, which lets SuperTab decide which 
completion mode to use and should play well with OmniCompletion:

>
    let g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = "context"
<

REFERENCES                                               *vtw-1486-references*
    - :help |:highlight| 


COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1486-comments*

==============================================================================

This tip shows how to easily jump to the next or previous method in a C++ 
program using a simple regular expression.

JUMP TO NEXT/PREVIOUS METHOD           *vtw-1666-jump-to-next/previous-method*

Put these lines in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] and you can 
press Alt-Shift-J (or Alt-Shift-K) to jump to the next (or previous) method in 
a C++ file:

>
    nnoremap <M-J> /\v^(\w+\s+)?\w+::\w+\(.*\)
    nnoremap <M-K> ?\v^(\w+\s+)?\w+::\w+\(.*\)
<

Better still, if this is in file `ftplugin/cpp.vim`, it only activates when 
editing C++ files.

This only works if the format of the method is:

>
    type classname::methodname(args)
<

==============================================================================

For a given vim-###-src#.tar.gz release there is only one vim.po file that 
can be created for translation purposes. However, this vim.po is not unique 
since several options may be set while extracting with 'xgettext', depending 
mostly on the format of comments. For your convenience you can download a 
standard vim.pot to use as a translation template for vim-6.1 to most any 
language(s):

http://lynxx.org/misc/download/vim-6.1-pot.tgz 
[http://lynxx.org/misc/download/vim-6.1-pot.tgz]

This is the general template for translating messages in Vim 6.1 using the 
Xgettext format. It contains all English messages in the (untranslated) form:

>
    msgid "ABC" - English text
    msgstr "" - candidate language
<

To translate Vim 6.1 messages, proceed line-by-line, taking care not to 
translate commands and options specific to the editor. See the GNU 'gettext' 
man-page for more info and details on this.

This vim.pot should be used only with v. 6.1 to translate to any language.

When Vim versions advance, a standard vim.po must be created from the newer 
sources, as explained in Vim goes INTL |vtw-546|.

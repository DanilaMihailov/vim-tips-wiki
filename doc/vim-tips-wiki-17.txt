==============================================================================

In insert mode, to allow the backspace key to erase previously entered 
characters, autoindent, and newlines, set the following option:

>
    :set backspace=indent,eol,start
<

Or:

>
    :set backspace=2
<

By default this option is empty, not allowing you to backspace over 
characters that weren't entered during the current insert mode session, the 
automatically inserted indentation, or across line breaks. This is the 
standard vi behavior.

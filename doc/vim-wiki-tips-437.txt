==============================================================================

Sometimes when you are working with an extended language (such as uC++) there 
exist keywords that are not included as keywords in the vim release, so you 
can easily update keywords in two ways.

1. edit your c.vim file [if you are coding c/c++] try 'vim61/runtime/syntax/' 
for location of these files, and add the keywords in the correct groups,

2. the second way is you can put them all in a separate file, and source it, 
eg: say i had some new c types, called uTask or uMutex i could get them 
highlighted as types using the following command:

>
    :syn keyword type uTask uMutex uNoMutex [etc..]

COMMENTS  *vwt-437-comments*

Rather than editing an existing syntax file which will get overwritten every 
time you upgrade to a newer revision or version of Vim, it's better if you 
simply create a file in the after/syntax directory (anywhere inside the 
'runtimepath') that has the same name as the file you're enhancing (c.vim, for 
example).

See :help 'runtimepath' for more details on both the runtimepath as well as 
the order in which files are loaded (which explains why the "after" directory 
works).

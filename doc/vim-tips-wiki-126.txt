Having problems setting up your syntax highlighting because everything is 
coming up in bold?

You're probably using an 8 color xterm and setting up highlighting lines such 
as hi Normal ... ctermfg=green . The solution: use numbers! 0=black, 1=red, 
2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue, 5=magenta, 6=cyan, and 7=white. Vim tries to use 
"bright" colors when its given names (because Windoz machines prefer to use 
dim text unless its been made bold).

Read more about it at :help |highlight-ctermfg|.

This works ok, but a more portable (and more predictable) way is to use the 
dark color names. i.e. use DarkBlue instead of Blue, Gray instead of White, 
etc. See :help |cterm-colors|.

If you are using a recent xterm try putting this in your .vimrc:

>
    if &term =~ "xterm"
      " don't do this if you have 8-color xterms
      set term=xterm-16color
    endif
<

And you will get the non-bolded versions of those colors (which means you 
have 16 colors to work with).

HOW MANY COLORS DOES MY XTERM SUPPORT? *vtw-126-how-many-colors-does-my-xterm-support?*

You can find out how many colors your xterm has by running

>
    strings `which xterm` | grep color[0-9]
<

(and maybe sort it someway). The highest value plus one is the number of 
colors you have. So, if you find that this is 256, then set

>
    set term=xterm-256color
<

instead.

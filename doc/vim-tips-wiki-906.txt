==============================================================================

Pasting text into a terminal running Vim with automatic indentation enabled 
can destroy the indentation of the pasted text. This tip shows how to avoid 
the problem.

See how to stop auto indenting |vtw-330| for automatic indentation issues 
while you are typing.

BACKGROUND                                                *vtw-906-background*

If you use Vim commands to paste text, nothing unexpected occurs. The problem 
only arises when pasting from another application, and only when you are not 
using a GUI version of Vim.

In a console or terminal version of Vim, there is no standard procedure to 
paste text from another application. Instead, the terminal may emulate pasting 
by inserting text into the keyboard buffer, so Vim thinks the text has been 
typed by the user. After each line ending, Vim may move the cursor so the next 
line starts with the same indent as the last. However, that will change the 
indentation already in the pasted text.

PASTE TOGGLE                                            *vtw-906-paste-toggle*

Vim provides the 'paste' option to aid in pasting text unmodified from other 
applications. You can set it manually like:

>
    :set paste
    :set nopaste
<

Or, Vim offers the 'pastetoggle' option to conveniently turn 'paste' on and 
off with one keypress.

Put the following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] (change 
<F2> to whatever key you want):

>
    set pastetoggle=<F2>
<

To paste from another application:
    - Start insert mode. 
    - Press F2 (toggles the 'paste' option on). 
    - Use your terminal to paste text from the clipboard. 
    - Press F2 (toggles the 'paste' option off). 


Then the existing indentation of the pasted text will be retained.

You do not have to start insert mode first, but if you are in normal mode and 
have a mapping for F2, that mapping will apply, and the 'pastetoggle' function 
will not operate.

Some people like the visual feedback shown in the status line by the 
following alternative for your vimrc:

>
    nnoremap <F2> :set invpaste paste?<CR>
    set pastetoggle=<F2>
    set showmode
<

The first line sets a mapping so that pressing F2 in normal mode will invert 
the 'paste' option, and will then show the value of that option. The second 
line allows you to press F2 when in insert mode, to toggle 'paste' on and off. 
The third line enables displaying whether 'paste' is turned on in insert mode.

REFERENCES                                                *vtw-906-references*
    - :help 'paste' 
    - :help 'pastetoggle' 


COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-906-comments*

For VIM running in recent terminals, you can use the excellent 
vim-bracketed-paste [https://github.com/ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste] 
plugin which automatically sets 'paste' option when, well, pasting.

OLD COMMENTS                                            *vtw-906-old-comments*
    - Thanks for your fix Spiiph, and please check what I changed. I think the 
      following is now attended to, and all these old comments can be deleted after 
      a few days. JohnBeckett [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:JohnBeckett] 01:39,

==============================================================================

I've applied this tip (under VIM 7.2), but when pressing F2 under insert mode 
it cycles through 3 different modes:

>
    -- (insert) --
    -- INSERT (paste) --
    -- INSERT --
<

So I have to hit F2 twice under insert mode to enter paste mode. Using this 
worked for me:

>
    nnoremap <F2> :set invpaste paste?<CR>
    imap <F2> <C-O>:set invpaste paste?<CR>
    set pastetoggle=<F2>
<

Who's 'me'? The imap is superfluous. I'm not sure why it was there from the start, since the 'showmode' option displays whether 'paste' is turned on or not.(Spiiph 12:08, January 12, 2010 (UTC))

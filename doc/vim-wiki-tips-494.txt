==============================================================================

I used to define two different mapping for maximize and restore window. But I 
wanted a map that can toggle between them. So, I came up with this function. 
This function assumes you are using win32 version of gvim. If you are using 
different version, then substitute :simlat ~[rx] by the key combination for 
your window manager.

Add following lines to your vimrc.

>
    let w:windowmaximized = 0
    function! MaxRestoreWindow()
      if w:windowmaximized == 1
        let w:windowmaximized = 0
        " restore the window
        :simalt ~r
      else
        let w:windowmaximized = 1
        " maximize the window
        :simalt ~x
      endif
    endfunction
    map <F5> :call MaxRestoreWindow()<CR>

I thought window scope should be used in this case, but it doesn't work when 
a window has multiple screen. It seems working with global variable.

    let g:WindowMaximized = 0
    function! MaxRestoreWindow()
      if g:WindowMaximized == 1
        let g:WindowMaximized = 0
        " restore the window
        :simalt ~r
      else
        let g:WindowMaximized = 1
        " maximize the window
        :simalt ~x
      endif
    endfunction

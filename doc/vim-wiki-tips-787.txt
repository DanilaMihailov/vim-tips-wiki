==============================================================================

Suppose you have a function requiring a count argument, and you would like to 
be able to invoke it with a mapping, and also allow the count to be prefixed 
to the mapping, like you can with for example {count}CTRL-^ (to edit the 
[count]th file in the buffer list).

Here is an example of code that can be used to call a Foo() function with 
such a prefix count argument. All it shows is the structure required for such 
a thing to work (well, it's the best the author of the tip was able to come up 
with). Given the following, typing 42,a will echo FOO: 42:

>
    function! Foo(count)
      echo 'FOO: ' . a:count
    endfunction
    
    command! -nargs=1 FooCmd call Foo(<args>)
    map ,a :<C-U>FooCmd(v:count)<CR>
<

REFERENCES                                                *vwt-787-references*
    - :help |v:count|

It's simpler if you use ":call", then you don't need to use "command". I have 
something like the following in my vimrc.

>
    nmap ,a :<C-U>call Foo(v:count)
    [...]
       function Foo(amount)
          execute "set columns +=" . a:amount
       endfunction

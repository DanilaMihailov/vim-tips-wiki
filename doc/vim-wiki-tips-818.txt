Under Windows, you can use TortoiseCVS along with Vim/GVim as the diff tool 
of choice:

Create a .bat file containing the following and put it in your path:

>
    @echo off
    "C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\GVim.exe" -d %1 %2
<

Add this .bat file as the diff utility under 
TortoiseCVS->Preferences->Tools->External Diff Application.

COMMENTS  *vwt-818-comments*

You don't have to create a .bat file to do this. Just enter "C:\Program 
Files\Vim63\GVim.exe" as "Diff application".

Set "Two-way diff parameters" as -d "%1" "%2".

==============================================================================

Not that Vim isn't good at diff'ing, but I use ExamDiff Pro 
(http://www.prestosoft.com [http://www.prestosoft.com]) for diff-ing with 
TortoiseCVS. Not free, but the display/ease of merging is great.

==============================================================================

I use WinMerge (http://www.winmerge.org [http://www.winmerge.org]). It's 
great.

==============================================================================

I'm using Meta-Diff (see http://meta-diff.sourceforge.net/ 
[http://meta-diff.sourceforge.net/]). It's configured to use Vim for source 
files, Examdiff for other text files, CSDiff for Word documents etc.

==============================================================================

You can type Ctrl-R to insert a register when in insert mode, or when typing 
in the command or search line. When you press Ctrl-R you will see `"` (quote) 
to prompt you to finish the command by entering a register. For example, press 
Ctrl-R then `a` to insert the contents of the `a` register, or Ctrl-R then `"` 
to insert the contents of the unnamed register.

You can press `v` then move the cursor to visually select some text (say the 
text is "hello world"). If you press `y` the selected text is yanked (copied) 
into the unnamed register. You can now type `:%s/` then <C-r>" (Ctrl-R quote), 
which would show the following in the command line:

>
    :%s/hello world
<

You could complete the substitute command, to read, for example:

>
    :%s/hello world/goodbye everyone/gc
<

Type <C-r><C-w> to paste the word under the cursor into the command line, or 
<C-r><C-a> to paste the WORD.

==============================================================================

You can make Vim scroll the text using the shifted up/down arrows by mapping 
Shift-Up to Ctrl-Y and Shift-Down to Ctrl-E.

>
    map <S-Down> <C-E>
    map <S-Up> <C-Y>
<

Shift-Down will then scroll down (like moving a scroll-bar down, or like 
moving a cursor at the bottom of a window down), and Shift-Up will then scroll 
up (like moving a scroll-bar up, etc).

If you'd rather think about the text moving down/up instead of the cursor 
moving up/down, you can of course swap the mappings.

If you normally use j and k for cursor movement, and rarely use the arrow 
keys, you can map the arrow keys directly, in which case I'd probably map the 
shifted arrow keys back to cursor movement:

>
    map <Down> <c-e>
    map <Up> <c-y>
    map <S-Down> j
    map <S-Up> k
<

Vim by default maps S-Down and S-Up to Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B, for both normal and 
visual mode. Keep this in mind if you change some of the above mappings to 
"nmap", because you'll probably also want to look in to "vmap".

This would be great, but doesn't work with my combination of secure F SSH 
(windows) and TERM=xterm. The arrows cannot be mapped as <Up>, etc, nor the 
<home> key. Any idea about why?

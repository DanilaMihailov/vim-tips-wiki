TO DO
    - I propose making this the "copy/paste mappings" tip, and merge in the various 
      other attempts. 
    - When finished, rename this tip (and maybe some of the others). 
    - Possibly have a section for Windows Ctrl-C/X/V stuff, and another for other 
      approaches. 
    - For Windows Ctrl-C/X/V, is there any need for a tip other than to explain 
      about mswin.vim? 
    - The wiki should explain how to use Vim properly, so a bunch of tips on making 
      Vim imitate Notepad are not helpful IMHO. However, one tip on Ctrl-C/X/V is 
      warranted (particularly now they are "standard" on Mac + Windows + Linux). 
    - Might keep some different approaches, but perhaps will just pick what appears 
      to be the "best". 
    - Use following list for related tips (probably will not merge them to here, 
      but may find some info in them that could be moved to this tip). 

    - Copy/paste mappings (this tip) 
    - 312 Copy, cut and paste |vwt-312| Copy/paste without selection 
    - 960 Copy an Entire Buffer to the Clipboard |vwt-960| Copy All 

    - 21 Easy pasting to Windows applications |vwt-21| :set clipboard=unnamed, :set 
      go+=a 
    - 687 Mac OS X clipboard sharing |vwt-687| 
    - 984 Accessing the system clipboard |vwt-984| 
    - 1511 In line copy and paste to system clipboard |vwt-1511| Mac OS X? 


CONTENT FROM VIMTIP356 (THIS TIP)  *vwt-356-content-from-vimtip356-(this-tip)*

Since I didn't want to interfere with the standard Vim mappings I removed all 
the <C-c>, <C-v>, etc. mappings found in the default vimrc. But quickly 
copy-pasting text is a must, so I added the following keymaps. This is very 
simple, but it works like a charm.

>
    vmap <C-Space> "ay
    nmap <C-Space> "aP
    imap <C-Space> <C-o>"ap
    nmap <C-c> "ayiw
<

I found the insertion mapping faulty: its behavior depended on whether I was 
at the end of the line. The following work well for me:

>
    vmap <C-c> "py
    nmap <C-c> "pyiw
    vmap <C-p> "pp
    nmap <C-p> "pP
    imap <C-p> <Esc>"ppa

Having replaced Notepad with gvim, these are my preferred editing shortcuts:

>
    " Copy to 'clipboard registry'
    vmap <C-c> "*y
    
    " Select all text
    nmap <C-a> ggVG
<

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-356-comments*

Have you seen vim70/mswin.vim, it comes with Vim 7.0 (and prior versions). It 
sets up a bunch of behavior that makes Vim work nice with Windows. Just source 
it in your vimrc. It's worth reading through for some ideas if you don't want 
to use the entire thing.

CONTENT FROM TIP 1528 (NOW REMOVED; CONTENT TO BE MERGED HERE) *vwt-356-content-from-tip-1528-(now-removed;-content-to-be-merged-here)*

Easy copy and paste in Vim:

>
    " normal copy/paste
    vmap <C-c> y<Esc>i
    vmap <C-x> d<Esc>i
    imap <C-v> <Esc>pi
    imap <C-y> <Esc>ddi
    map <C-z> <Esc>
    imap <C-z> <Esc>ui
<

How it works:

Select something in visual mode. Then Ctrl-c (copy), Ctrl-x (cut).

After the operation you are in insert mode. So just navigate to the place 
where you want to paste and do Ctrl-v

When in insert mode Ctrl-y deletes the current line, Ctrl-z undo last change.

TODO                                                            *vwt-356-todo*

Need to state whether this is for a particular operating system. Does it work 
with the system clipboard? If not, is it useful?

See :help |:behave| for usage of mswin.vim. Most installs of Vim on Windows 
use mswin.vim. In that case, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-X, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z just behave as a 
Windows user would expect, and the tip as now written has no point.

If using gvim without mswin.vim (a good idea), look at the Edit menu for the 
recommended keys.

If wanting the mswin.vim key mappings, is there a reason to use this tip 
rather than mswin.vim?

What's wrong with the default? In Vim 7.1, see the files distributed with 
Vim:
    - vim/vim71/macmap.vim, vim/vim71/menu.vim, vim/vim71/mswin.vim 
    - vim/vim71/autoload/paste.vim

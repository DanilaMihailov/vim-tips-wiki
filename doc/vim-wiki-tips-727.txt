In 1:6.2-532+1 helpfiles was changed back to not being compressed anymore 
since that broke :helpg[rep]. That meant that instead of having the suffix 
.txt.gz they where back to just .txt. Naturally the helpfiles (opened by :help 
with friends) opens with 'nomodifiable' set since you are supposed to read 
them and not edit them. For me that made a problem since i had an :au (auto 
command) in my vimrc setting *.txt to have the iso-8859-1 (latin-1) 
fileencoding. Now I got an error every time I wanted to use the help system. 
To overcome this I changed my vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] from 
this:

>
    au BufNewFile,BufRead mutt*,*.txt,*/.followup set tw=77 ai nocindent fileencoding=iso-8859-1
<

to this:

>
    " 'nomodifiable' disallows changes to 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' so remove those entries in the else clause
    function! Noma_workaround()
      if exists("modifiable")
        set tw=77 ai nocindent fileencoding=iso-8859-1
      else
        set tw=77 ai nocindent
      endif
    endfunction
    au BufNewFile,BufRead mutt*,*.txt,*/.followup call Noma_workaround()
<

In short this just mean that I call the Noma_workaround() function to 
determine if I can set the fileencoding or if that will give an error. In that 
case I jsut set the other options.

Your Noma_workaround will almost never set 'filencoding' to latin1 because

>
    if exists("modifiable")
<

tests the existence of a _variable_ with that name. To test the _option_ with 
that name, you should use

>
    if exists("+modifiable")
<

to test if the option is functional, and/or

>
    if &modifiable
<

to test if it is currently true.

See :help |exists()|

==============================================================================

It is convenient to temporarily fold away (hide) parts of your file, leaving 
only an outline of the major parts visible. This tip presents an overview of 
using folding.

Many programming languages have a syntax file that supports folding. 
Typically, each function is regarded as a fold that can be opened or closed. 
With all folds closed, you see only the first line of each function for an 
overview of the program.

FOLDING METHODS  *vwt-108-folding-methods*

To activate folding in your text, you will need to set the 'foldmethod' 
option.

The 'foldmethod' option (abbreviated to 'fdm') is local to each window. It 
determines what kind of folding applies in the current window. Possible values 
are:
    - manual – folds must be defined by entering commands (such as  |zf|)
    - indent – groups of lines with the same indent form a fold
    - syntax – folds are defined by syntax highlighting
    - expr   – folds are defined by a user-defined expression
    - marker – special characters can be manually or automatically added to your text to flag the start and end of folds
    - diff – used to fold unchanged text when viewing differences (automatically set in diff mode)


MANUAL FOLDING  *vwt-108-manual-folding*

Normally it is best to use an automatic folding method, but manual folding is 
simple and can be useful for dealing with small folds.

When foldmethod is set to manual (or marker), a fold can be created in Normal 
mode by typing zf{motion}. For example, zf'a will fold from the current line 
to wherever the mark a has been set, or zf3j folds the current line along with 
the following 3 lines. If you want to create folds in a text file that uses 
curly braces to delimit code blocks ({...}), you can use the command zfa} to 
create a fold for the current code block.

Alternatively, an arbitrary group of lines can be folded by selecting them to 
enter Visual mode and pressing zf. This allows you to preview the section 
you've selected before you fold it. The above example of folding the current 
code block could also be accomplished by first selecting the code block 
delimited by the curly braces (va}) and then creating the fold (zf). Putting 
this together gives va}zf.

Manual folds can also be created in Command mode :{range}fo[ld], e.g., the 
current line along with the following three lines (as in the example above) 
can be folded by running :,+3fo.

Use zd to delete the fold at the cursor (no text is deleted, just the fold 
markers); zD is used to recursively delete folds at the cursor.

INDENT FOLDING  *vwt-108-indent-folding*

As noted above, with 'foldmethod' set to indent, lines with the same level of 
indentation will be folded together. Note this means text like this:

>
    Line one
      Line two
      Line three
    Line four
<

will be folded as follows, which may not be expected:

>
    Line one
    + Line two and three
    Line four
<

Since folding by indent may not be as clear as you like, the foldcolumn is 
especially useful for this method. Setting foldcolumn to at least the level of 
folds you want displayed will show a sidebar, in which you can see which lines 
in the file can be folded, or are already folded, with a '+' (closed) or '-' 
(open) indicator.

SYNTAX FOLDING  *vwt-108-syntax-folding*

Try :setlocal foldmethod=syntax. Many syntax files define folding based on 
the language syntax, although you may need to enable it by setting syntax file 
options |vwt-1534|. If a specific syntax file doesn't define folding, you can 
define your own [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Syntax_folding_of_Vim_scripts].

Note that this particular fold method especially may define too many folds 
for your liking. You can change this using the 'foldnestmax' option, by 
setting it to a value low enough for your liking.

INDENT FOLDING WITH MANUAL FOLDS  *vwt-108-indent-folding-with-manual-folds*

If you like the convenience of having Vim define folds automatically by 
indent level, but would also like to create folds manually, you can get both 
by putting this in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    augroup vimrc
      au BufReadPre * setlocal foldmethod=indent
      au BufWinEnter * if &fdm == 'indent' | setlocal foldmethod=manual | endif
    augroup END
<

The first autocommand sets 'indent' as the fold method before a file is 
loaded, so that indent-based folds will be defined. The second one allows you 
to manually create folds while editing. It's executed after the modeline is 
read, so it won't change the fold method if the modeline set the fold method 
to something else like 'marker' or 'syntax'.

FOLDING BY EXPRESSION  *vwt-108-folding-by-expression*

This is the most complicated, but also the most powerful fold method. You can 
use it to fold in pretty much any way you desire. For example, you could fold 
away text not matching a regular expression 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Folding_with_Regular_Expression]. See :help 
'foldexpr' for details.

FOLDING WITH MARKERS  *vwt-108-folding-with-markers*

Setting foldmethod to "marker" is similar to manual folding, because you can 
use zf and zd to add/remove folds, and all folds are defined manually. 
However, it works by adding special markers to your buffer text so that the 
same folds can be loaded by anyone opening the file in Vim. The markers are 
defined by the 'foldmarker' option, which defaults to three consecutive open 
curly braces to start a fold and three consecutive closed curly braces to end 
a fold. This method is mostly useful when the other options don't give 
satisfactory results, either because a syntax file does not define folding, 
you want to break up a file into logical portions instead of syntactical 
constructs, or you are folding plain text in some way.

If you change the default 'foldmarker' setting, be sure to communicate the 
correct setting to other people in some way. An especially effective method 
for this would be to use a modeline 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Modeline_magic], so that most Vim users will get 
your intended settings by default when they edit the file.

DIFF FOLDING  *vwt-108-diff-folding*

This foldmethod should never be set manually without very good reason. It is 
the default fold method when using Vim in diff mode. Simply running any of the 
commands to put Vim in diff mode will set this option for you. It works by 
folding away lines that do not differ between the buffers in the diff, so that 
you can focus on the lines with differences. Note that you can tweak the 
number of lines to leave unfolded, using the 'diffopt' option.

If you want folding in diff/patch files, see Folding for diff files 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Folding_for_diff_files] instead.

OPENING AND CLOSING FOLDS  *vwt-108-opening-and-closing-folds*

The command zc will close a fold (if the cursor is in an open fold), and zo 
will open a fold (if the cursor is in a closed fold). It's easier to just use 
za which will toggle the current fold (close it if it was open, or open it if 
it was closed).

The commands zc (close), zo (open), and za (toggle) operate on one level of 
folding, at the cursor. The commands zC, zO and zA are similar, but operate on 
all folding levels (for example, the cursor line may be in an open fold, which 
is inside another open fold; typing zC would close all folds at the cursor).

The command zr reduces folding by opening one more level of folds throughout 
the whole buffer (the cursor position is not relevant). Use zR to open all 
folds.

The command zm gives more folding by closing one more level of folds 
throughout the whole buffer. Use zM to close all folds.

MAPPINGS TO TOGGLE FOLDS  *vwt-108-mappings-to-toggle-folds*

With the following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], you can 
toggle folds open/closed by pressing F9. In addition, if you have :set 
foldmethod=manual, you can visually select some lines, then press F9 to create 
a fold.

>
    inoremap <F9> <C-O>za
    nnoremap <F9> za
    onoremap <F9> <C-C>za
    vnoremap <F9> zf
<

Here is an alternative procedure: In normal mode, press Space to toggle the 
current fold open/closed. However, if the cursor is not in a fold, move to the 
right (the default behavior). In addition, with the manual fold method, you 
can create a fold by visually selecting some lines, then pressing Space.

>
    nnoremap <silent> <Space> @=(foldlevel('.')?'za':"\<Space>")<CR>
    vnoremap <Space> zf
<

In the first mapping for Space, @= refers to the expression register (:help 
|@=|). The following expression is evaluated when Enter is pressed (<CR>). The 
value of foldlevel('.') is determined (the fold level at the current line, or 
zero if the current line is not in a fold). If the result is nonzero (true), 
the result is 'za' (toggle fold); otherwise it is "\<Space>", which evaluates 
back to the default behaviour of the <Space> key (move forward by one 
character). :help |expr1|

SAVING FOLDS BEFORE CLOSING VIM  *vwt-108-saving-folds-before-closing-vim*

Vim provides a good mechanism called view. You can use it to save a fold. See 
Make views automatic |vwt-991|. You may also want to use plugin 
restore_view.vim [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4021].

COMMANDS OVER FOLDS  *vwt-108-commands-over-folds*

Folds can be created using one of the methods described above. Then, all the 
folds can be closed using zM. Now, commands can be executed on each line that 
is folded, using :folddoc <command>. Reopen the folds using zR to see the 
results.

Todo: Explain how a command stored in a register can be executed this way. Ctrl-r, followed by the register name does not appear to execute the set of keystrokes for each line that is folded?

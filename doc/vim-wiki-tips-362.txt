==============================================================================

I couldn't get any tags to match in Coldfusion files *.cfm either HTML 
Javascript or ColdFusion tags themselves <cfif ..> ... </cfif>

Much pain was gone thru before I realised that the Syntax File for ColdFusion 
(/syntax/cf.vim) was called cf and not cfm

Therefore in matchit.cfm I need to add CF in following line and NOT CFM

>
    au FileType html,jsp,php,cf if !exists("b:match_words") |

COMMENTS  *vwt-362-comments*

I meant edit matchit.vim (not matchit.cfm)

Ok, Where is this supposed to go exactly? I'm a little confused.

==============================================================================

this is a fairly complex topic and I can't outdo the included docs; It's not 
as quick to set up as really any other of vims powerful features that I have 
used before, but its very worthwhile though, if you ask me. Note that it's 
still quite easy, but usually vim has all the work done for you already with a 
full install.

Start with

>
    :h matchit-install
<

Then follow its instructions to install matchit and get the help loaded for 
it for the rest of the info.

That is a very general guide for dealing with just about any language, but if 
you're doing coldfusion, I will add one more shortcut for you. You'll probably 
want to start with this, in ~/.vim/ftplugin/cf.vim (or 
vimfiles\ftplugin\cf.vim )

    " Only do this when not done yet for this buffer
    if exists("b:did_ftplugin")
      finish
    endif
    
    " Don't load another plugin for this buffer
    let b:did_ftplugin = 1
    
    if exists("loaded_matchit")
        let b:match_words = '<cfif\>.\{-}>\|<cfif\>.\{-}$:'
                \ . '<cfelseif\>.\{-}>\|<cfelseif\>.\{-}$:'

For the benefit of Googlers, I am going to mention that the point of this tip 
is to help people configure vim so that one can use the % (percent sign) to 
jump from word to word, using matched pairs like those mentioned above while 
writing coldfusion cfm files.

==============================================================================

In Vim, you may want to format long lines, that is, wrap long lines so the 
longest is, say, 80 characters.

The standard approach is to set the local 'textwidth' option, then use `gq` 
to format the wanted lines.

>
    :setl tw=80
    gggqG
<

In the above, `gggqG` is `gg` (go to the first line) then `gq` (format) to 
`G` (the last line).

That works, but it also joins consecutive short lines together although it 
does not join lines that are separated with an empty line. For example, this 
text:

>
    hello
    world
    
    final
<

would be formatted to:

>
    hello world
    
    final
<

To wrap long lines without affecting short lines, use:

>
    :g/./ normal gqq
<

The g command [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Power_of_g] executes `normal gqq` 
on each line matching `.` (any line with at least one character). The 
normal-mode `gqq` command then formats that line.

An alternative would be to use the par text reformatter 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Par_text_reformatter]. The following replaces 
each line that is 80 or more characters with the result of running par. If the 
buffer contains 1000 long lines, this will call par 1000 times.

>
    :g/.\{80,\}/ .!par w70
<

This need arises when you copy/paste a programming snippet into Vim, and you 
want to leave the indented code alone, but format the long explanation.

How is this better than `gq` with a line width of 80?

This IS better than gq with a line width of 80 because it prevents short lines without empty line between them from being concatenated! --February 3, 2016
See :help 'formatprg'. You could probably get the best of both worlds. --Fritzophrenic (talk)

==============================================================================

To run Perl scripts under Windows, you can either add the .pl extension to 
the PATHEXT environment variable, or use pl2bat, which comes with 
ActiveState's Perl and makes a very nice batch file. A quirk of Perl under 
Win32 is that piping doesn't work with .pl files (as in bar.pl | foo.pl) but 
works fine with the batch files. It has something to do with how Windows loads 
files. Anyway, this all works fine, but every time I do any extensive edits to 
a Perl/batch file, I have to set cindent and syntax=perl or it drives me 
crazy.

FILETYPE.VIM                                            *vtw-638-filetype.vim*

To make one change that will apply to any scripts created by pl2bat, edit 
your user (~/.vim) or machine ($VIMRUNTIME/vimfiles) version of filetype.vim 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Filetype.vim] to include a .bat analysis rule:

>
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.bat 	if getline(1) =~ '--\*-Perl-\*--' | setf perl | endif
<

This will cause Vim to scan any .bat files for `--*-Perl-*--` on the first 
line, and if it's found it will be treated as a Perl file, otherwise the 
predefined rules for .bat extensions will run.

See :help |new-filetype| (section C).

MODELINE                                                    *vtw-638-modeline*

You can specify the following text as the first line of the converted file 
(by manual edit or changing the pl2bat generation) to contain the following to 
not need to edit the filetype definition. However, this method only applies to 
each file changed in such a manner.

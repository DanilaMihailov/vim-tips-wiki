==============================================================================

Normally, typing edit on a Unix system brings up the vi editor and not Vim.If 
you've installed Vim in your home directory somewhere,you don't have a root 
account, and you want tomake Vim the default editor for anything you do(e.g. 
edit a SQL statement in SQLplus), define these three variables in your 
.profile:

>
    VIM=<base directory where Vim executable is placed>
    VIMRUNTIME=<base directory where Vim runtimes are kept>
    EDITOR=$VIM/vim
    
    E.g:
    VIMRUNTIME=/usr/bin
    EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
<

If you've installed vim with another name (say, vim.exe) thenchange 
EDITOR=$VIM/vim to EDITOR=$VIM/vim.exe

Source .profile, and the next time you start an editor from anyprogram you'll 
bring up Vim.

On Ubuntu (or other Debian-based systems), update-alternatives can be used to 
change the default editor:

>
    sudo update-alternatives --config editor
    # Type the number which corresponds to Vim here (after installing it) then press Enter.
<

$EDITOR is the defined variable that programs on Unix-like operating systems 
are supposed to use for the default editor. Actually, $VISUAL is another 
defined variable for a non line-oriented editor, which is technically the 
correct role for Vim. Many notable programs on Unix support these variables, 
though obviously there are a few that for various reasons do not.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-175-comments*

Note that if you built Vim manually rather installed your distribution's 
package, it may not show up in the list presented by update-alternatives, you 
will need to add it:

>
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor /usr/bin/vim 100

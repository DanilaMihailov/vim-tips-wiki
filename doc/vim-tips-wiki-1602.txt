==============================================================================

The coding style for one project may use `CamelCase` for variables, while 
another may use `under_scores`. Here are some Vim procedures to switch between 
CamelCase and under_score variable names.

CONVERTING PHP VARIABLES                   *vtw-1602-converting-php-variables*

This is a simple procedure to change variables names from 
`$this_variable_style` to `$thisVariableStyle`.

The commands below define these mappings:
    - `+` Find the next `$variable_with_underscores`. 
    - `_` Convert the next underscore on the current line. 


When required, you can yank the following lines in Vim (on the first line, 
type `2Y`), then execute them (type `@"`) to map the `+` and `_` keys.

>
    :nnoremap + /\$\w\+_<CR>
    :nnoremap _ f_x~
<

Now you can press `+` to search for the next `$variable_with_underscores`, 
then press `_` to find and delete the next underscore and toggle the case of 
the next character. Repeatedly press `_` until all underscores are processed, 
then press `+` to find the next variable. For example, you may type 
`+__+_+___` to skip through a file.

Type `+~` for initial capitals.

The simple procedure above is suitable for manually changing a small number 
of variables, while inspecting each change. Using a substitute, the process 
can be automated. The following command will change all variables names from 
`$this_variable_style` to `$thisVariableStyle`:

>
    :%s#\%($\%(\k\+\)\)\@<=_\(\k\)#\u\1#g
<

If wanted, the `\v` (very magic) option can be used to reduce the number of 
backslashes, and the conventional `/` can be used as the delimiter instead of 
`#`. The following command is equivalent to the above:

>
    :%s/\v%(\$%(\k+))@<=_(\k)/\u\1/g
<

CHANGE UNDER_SCORES TO CAMELCASE   *vtw-1602-change-under_scores-to-camelcase*

The following shows two substitute commands for converting names with 
underscores to camel case. The first command converts the beginning character 
to uppercase, while the second leaves it unchanged. Both commands operate on 
all underscore names in the current line.

>
    " Convert each name_like_this to NameLikeThis in current line.
    :s#\(\%(\<\l\+\)\%(_\)\@=\)\|_\(\l\)#\u\1\2#g
    
    " Convert each name_like_this to nameLikeThis in current line.
    :s#_\(\l\)#\u\1#g
    
    " Test (first line is original; second and third are results from above).
    " CONSTANT ab_cd_ef some words name_like_this and another_name = some_more
    " CONSTANT AbCdEf some words NameLikeThis and AnotherName = SomeMore
    " CONSTANT abCdEf some words nameLikeThis and anotherName = someMore
<

Copy the above text into Vim. In Vim, move the cursor to the first substitute 
command and press `Y` to copy the line. Move the cursor to the line containing 
the underscore names in the test text and type `@"` to execute the copied 
substitute command. That will change each underscore name to camel case in the 
current line.

The command uses the `\l` pattern to search for lowercase letters, so it will 
work correctly to convert `abc_def_ghi` to `AbcDefGhi`, but it will convert 
`abc1_def2_ghi` to `abc1Def2Ghi` (where the first character is still 
lowercase).

==============================================================================

Alternate command:

>
    :1,$s/_\([a-z]\)/\u\1/g
<

It looks for any places with an underscore followed by a lower case letter 
and replaces that with an upper case letter.

CHANGE UNDER_SCORES TO CAMELCASE   *vtw-1602-change-under_scores-to-camelcase*

>
    " Convert each NAME_LIKE_THIS to NameLikeThis in the current line.
    :s#_*\(\u\)\(\u*\)#\1\L\2#g
<

CHANGE CAMELCASE TO UNDER_SCORES   *vtw-1602-change-camelcase-to-under_scores*

The following shows two substitute commands for converting camel case names 
to names with underscores. The first command is slightly simpler but fails if 
the name contains numbers. Both commands operate on all camel case names in 
the current line.

>
    " Convert each NameLikeThis to name_like_this in current line.
    :s#\(\<\u\l\+\|\l\+\)\(\u\)#\l\1_\l\2#g
    
    " Alternative: accept numbers in name.
    :s#\C\(\<\u[a-z0-9]\+\|[a-z0-9]\+\)\(\u\)#\l\1_\l\2#g
    
    " Test (first line is original; second is result from above).
    " CONSTANT AbCdEf some words NameLikeThis and AnotherName = someMore
    " CONSTANT ab_cd_ef some words name_like_this and another_name = some_more
<

If wanted, the substitute commands can be applied to the whole buffer using 
`%` to indicate "all lines". For example, the second command applied to the 
whole buffer would be:

>
    :%s#\C\(\<\u[a-z0-9]\+\|[a-z0-9]\+\)\(\u\)#\l\1_\l\2#g
<

Be sure to run a diff to verify that the substitute has changed what you 
want.

    - Tim Pope's Abolish [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1545] 
      plugin includes mappings for case conversion of the word under the cursor, 
      such as `crs` and `crc` to convert to snake case or camel case.

    - lh-style plugin [https://github.com/LucHermitte/lh-style] provides two 
      commands to convert to an exact style (UpperCamelCase, snake_case, 
      lowerCamelCase), or to a semantic style (variable, getter, setter, constant, 
      function, member, parameter, local, global, ... -- the exact style can be 
      configured for each kind). `:NameConvert snake` will convert the word under 
      the cursor to snake_case, `%ConvertNames/\<m_\w\+(/getter/gc` will convert 
      occurrences of the pattern to getter names, after user confirmation. 


COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1602-comments*

If during your formatting you messed up reserved function definitions e.g. 
you changed `__init__` to `_Init__`, you can run

>
    :%s/\C_[A-Z][a-z]*__/\="_".tolower(submatch(0))
<

to rectify the definitions. --August 14, 2016

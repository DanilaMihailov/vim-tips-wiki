==============================================================================

In insert mode, pressing Ctrl-W deletes the previous word (:help |word|). If 
a non-Vim method is wanted, the following mapping can be used in gvim to allow 
Ctrl-Backspace to be used instead of Ctrl-W:

>
    " Map Ctrl-Backspace to delete the previous word in insert mode.
    imap <C-BS> <C-W>
<

If the mapping is always wanted, place the above in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

By default, Ctrl-W only deletes previous words in the text entered after last 
starting insert mode, and stops deleting text at the beginning of a line. The 
'backspace' option [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Backspace_and_delete_problems] 
can be set to control what is wanted. For example, the following causes Ctrl-W 
to always delete the previous word:

>
    :set backspace=indent,eol,start
<

Mapping Ctrl-Backspace does not work in terminal Vim. Following is a 
workaround.

>
    noremap! <C-BS> <C-w>
    noremap! <C-h> <C-w>
<

==============================================================================

There are some issues with <C-w>. For example it considers the insert mode's 
point of entry as a word boundary. Also, in readline <C-w> usually means to 
kill the previous WORD. There is a way to make it more readline-ish:

>
    inoremap <C-w> <C-\><C-o>dB
    inoremap <C-BS> <C-\><C-o>db
<

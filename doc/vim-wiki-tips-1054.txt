==============================================================================

I was getting frustrated with the default undo behavior in Vim because 
sometimes one of my "changes" would be very long (many lines), and I would 
want to undo one line at a time. So I came up with the idea to change the 
behavior with the following code that can be inserted into your vimrc:

>
    function! EnterStuff()
      let theLine = getline(line("."))
      let pos = col("'^")
      execute "normal mqu\<C-r>`q"
      if(pos > len(theLine))
        startinsert!
      else
        if(pos > 1)
          normal l
        endif
        startinsert
      endif
    endfunction
    
    function! ChangeUndoMode(theNum)
      if(a:theNum == 1)
        inoremap <C-w> <C-w>^O^[
        inoremap <CR> <Esc>:call EnterStuff()<CR><CR>
      elseif(a:theNum == 2)
        inoremap <C-w> <C-w>^O^[
        inoremap <BS> <BS>^O^[
        inoremap <DEL> <DEL>^O^[
        inoremap <CR> <Esc>:call EnterStuff()<CR><CR>
      else
        iunmap <C-w>
        iunmap <BS>
        iunmap <DEL>
        iunmap <CR>
      endif
    endfunction
    call ChangeUndoMode(1)
    nmap \sun :call ChangeUndoMode(1)<CR>
    nmap \gun :call ChangeUndoMode(2)<CR>
    nmap \bun :call ChangeUndoMode(3)<CR>
<

Be sure to write "^O^[" as two characters: ctrl-o and ESC.

So the above code works fairly well. <C-w>, <BS>, <DEL>, <CR> all add to the 
undo list. The <CR> one took me a long time to figure out. The way it is done 
in the above code is the only way I know that doesn't mess up indentation. 
^O^[ automatically screws up indentation.

You can use <c-g>u to break the undo chain:

>
    inoremap <BS> <c-g>u<BS>
    inoremap <CR> <c-g>u<CR>
    inoremap <del> <c-g>u<del>
    inoremap <c-w> <c-g>u<c-w>
<

should have the same effects.

==============================================================================

One more thing you can do is hit <End> while typing a sentence to end the 
undo sequence. The only reason <C-g>u is needed in the above example is 
because it doesn't screw up auto-indentation. Normally though, hitting <End> 
is a great way to end the undo sequence.

==============================================================================

My <End> does not break the undo chain. I had to explicitly imap it to do so:

>
    inoremap <End> <C-g>u<End>
<

==============================================================================

The <C-G>u trick seems not to be mentioned in gvim 6.1 docs and does not work 
either with this version.

==============================================================================

Be careful: "<C-g>u<Space>" breaks abbreviations induced by a <Space>

==============================================================================

Very odd. Try

>
    :imap <Space> <Space><C-g>u
<

to make abbrevs work. Do not try

>
    :imap <Space> <C-g>u<Space>
<

Vim will hang after using Space (use <C-c> to stop).

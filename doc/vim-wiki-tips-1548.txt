==============================================================================

I was using the Python omni-completion feature in Vim, and I noticed that 
when you complete a module name, it inserts the module name, followed by a dot 
(presumably because you would then want to access something inside the 
module). This is helpful, except that it breaks common omnicompletion 
keybindings, such as

>
    imap <silent> <buffer> . .<C-X><C-O>
<

In order to get completions for this module, one would have to either 
manually type <C-X><C-O> to run the completion function again, or delete and 
then re-insert the period. The correct solution is, of course, to fix the 
Python omnicompletion module. However, this 'feature' is present in all 
default installations of Vim.

Here is a stopgap solution. On <CR>, it accepts the current completion, and 
then runs a <C-R>= expression that checks to see if the character before the 
cursor is a '.'. If it is, then it runs omnicomplete again. The tricky bit 
about this is that it needs to accept the completion before it can check the 
cursor position, or else it will be checking against the partially completed 
text. The col('.')-1 check avoids a problem where you return without a 
selected match which lands you at column 1 of the next line.

    imap <silent> <expr> <buffer> <CR> pumvisible() ? "<CR><C-R>=(col('.')-1&&match(getline(line('.')), '\\.',
          \ col('.')-2) == col('.')-2)?\"\<lt>C-X>\<lt>C-O>\":\"\"<CR>"
          \ : "<CR>"

How do you enabled omnicompletion for modules, does it work for external 
modules too?

Is there a version of vim that doesn't have the "feature" that you mentioned? 
Is there a way to fix this and complile vim yourself?

This tip contains information about adjusting the indent of source code in a 
block formed by braces (`{...}`), such as is used in the C language.

COMMANDS TO INDENT BLOCKS                  *vtw-597-commands-to-indent-blocks*

Suppose the indent options are correctly defined and we find this badly 
indented code:

>
    int myfunction(int a)
     {
     if ( a == 1 ) {
     printf("one");
    return 1;        // the cursor is in this line
     }
     return 0;
       }
<

These commands will fix the indents:
    - `=i{` reindents "inner block" (inside the braces). 
    - `=a{` reindents "a block" (including the braces). 
    - `=2a{` reindents 2 blocks (this block and containing block). 


Instead of "{", you can use "}" or "B", for example, `=aB` indents a block.

These commands will decrease or increase indents:
    - >i{ increase indent for inner block. 
    - `.` repeat last change (increase indent of block again). 
    - `<i{` decrease indent for inner block. 


With the cursor on `{` or `}`:
    - `=%` indents the block (including matching brace). 
    - >% or `<%` indents or unindents the block. 


COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-597-comments*

TO DO
    - Check advice. 
    - Perhaps add more `vaB`, `viB`, >aB, >iB.

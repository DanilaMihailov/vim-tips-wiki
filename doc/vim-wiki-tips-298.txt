==============================================================================

There are times that you might like to go through a file and change the case 
of characters that match some criteria. This can be done easily using regular 
expressions.

In a substitute command [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace], 
place \U or \L before backreferences for the desired output. Everything after 
\U, stopping at \E or \e, is converted to uppercase. Similarly, everything 
after \L, stopping at \E or \e, is converted to lowercase.

Alternatively, use \u to uppercase only the first character of what follows, 
or \l to lowercase only the first character.

For example, assume a line with the text "This is a test".

>
    :s/\(test\)/\U\1 file/
<

produces: This is a TEST FILE

>
    :s/\(test\)/\U\1\e file/
<

produces: This is a TEST file

A backreference is part of a regular expression that refers to a previous 
part of the regular expression. The most common backreferences are & (all the 
matched text), \1 (the matched text within the first \(...\)), \2 (the match 
within the second), and so on.

Some examples that demonstrate the power of this technique:

Lowercase the entire file

>
    :%s/.*/\L&/
<

Uppercase all words that are preceded by < (an opening HTML tag):

>
    :%s/<\(\w*\)/<\U\1/g
<

Note also the gu<motion> and gU<motion> commands.

For example, ggguG will lowercase the entire file.(gg = go to top, gu = 
lowercase, G = go to EOF).

==============================================================================

By using the \0 general backref instead of the name ones (\1, \2 etc) you can 
save some typing for on replace stanza of the regex.

    This regex upper cases an explicit set of words to uppercase in a file.
    :%s/\(select\)\|\(order)\|\(by\)\|\(from\)\|\(where\)/\U\0/g
    
    Not rocket science, but otherwise you'd have to do this:
    :%s/\(select\)\|\(order)\|\(by\)\|\(from\)\|\(where\)/\U\1\U\2\U\3\U\4\U\5/g
    
    [edit:  Much easier to just use this, where either 0 or 1 will work:]
    :%s/\(select\|order\|by\|from\|where\)/\U\1/g
<

==============================================================================

convert HTML-Tags to uppercase

>
    :%s/<\/\=\(\w\+\)\>/\U&/g
<

or to lowercase

>
    :%s/<\/\=\(\w\+\)\>/\L&/g
<

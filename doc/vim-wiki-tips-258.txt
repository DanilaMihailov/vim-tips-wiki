==============================================================================

Ever wondered how long the current word is? This can be quite useful when 
editing data files. Add the following to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    nnoremap <C-_> :echo 'word' expand('<cword>') 'has length' strlen(expand('<cword>'))<CR>
<

Then press Ctrl-_ to display the word under the cursor, and its length. The 
length is the number of bytes in the word, which is not the same as the number 
of characters if a multi-byte encoding is used. To get the number of 
characters, use:

>
    nnoremap <C-_> :echo 'word' expand('<cword>') 'has length' strlen(substitute(expand('<cword>'), '.', 'x', 'g'))<CR>
<

For strings that aren't words, use the following to show the number of bytes 
in visually selected text when Ctrl-_ is pressed:

>
    vnoremap <C-_> "-y:echo 'text' @- 'has length' strlen(@-)<CR>
<

It would be better to use :set showcmd to display the length (in bytes and 
characters) of any visually selected text. Then type viw to select the current 
word and show its length (v starts a character-wise visual selection and iw 
selects the inner word).

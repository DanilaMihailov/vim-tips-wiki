==============================================================================

To use Vim as a man-page viewer involves setting an environment variable and 
adding a line to your .vimrc file.

Add the following line to your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    let $PAGER=''
<

You need to do this to clear the PAGER environment variable inside of Vim. 
This is to handle the case where you start Vim normally and want to use Vim's 
"Man" function.

bash, ksh, and Bourne variants add to .bashrc, .kshrc, etc.:

>
    export PAGER="/bin/sh -c \"unset PAGER;col -b -x | \
        vim -R -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -c 'map q :q<CR>' \
        -c 'map <SPACE> <C-D>' -c 'map b <C-U>' \
        -c 'nmap K :Man <C-R>=expand(\\\"<cword>\\\")<CR><CR>' -\""
<

csh, tcsh, and C-shell variants add to .cshrc:

>
    setenv PAGER /bin/sh\ -c\ \"unset\ PAGER\;col\ -b\ -x\ \|\ vim\ -c\ \'set\ ft=man\ nomod\ nolist\'\ -\"
<

fish add to .config/functions/config.fish

>
    set -x PAGER "/bin/sh -c \"unset PAGER;col -b -x | \
        vim -R -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -c 'map q :q<CR>' \
        -c 'map <SPACE> <C-D>' -c 'map b <C-U>' \
        -c 'nmap K :Man <C-R>=expand(\\\"<cword>\\\")<CR><CR>' -\""
<

The man pages will then be displayed with Vim called as "view" and will use 
the <man.vim> syntax highlighting. I myself use some additional highlighting 
which is enabled by putting the following file into 
<.vim/after/syntax/man.vim>. I usually use the astronaut colorscheme; those 
who use bright backgrounds may find the colors selected for manSubSectionStart 
and manSubSection something they'll want to change:

>
    " DrChip's additional man.vim stuff
    syn match manSectionHeading "^\s\+[0-9]\+\.[0-9.]*\s\+[A-Z].*$" contains=manSectionNumber
    syn match manSectionNumber "^\s\+[0-9]\+\.[0-9]*" contained

COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-167-comments*

As part of the man filetype plugin delivered in Vim 6.0, the user command 
:Man is setup to view man pages in a similar fashion. (On Unix) I've 
sym-linked the man.vim filetype plugin from the distribution into the plugin 
directory. That was the :Man command is available whenever you need it.

runtime ftplugin/man.vim
source $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/man.vim
e? :]

==============================================================================

I had to use PAGER variable instead of MANPAGER. Version of the man tool I 
use is 2.3.10. People who would like to try this may like to check tip 
VimTip121 |vtw-121| too.

==============================================================================

Some notes:

1. Some versions of sh don't support setting environment variables and 
exporting on the same line. In that case, you'd have to do:

>
    > MANPAGER="col -b | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -"
    > export MANPAGER
<

2. Another comment mentioned that their man doesn't support the MANPAGER env 
var, so they had to use PAGER. You probably don't want to do that on a 
permanent basis, since PAGER is used for many other things besides man. 
Instead, you might create a small script in your $HOME/bin that sets it in a 
subshell, for example (vman.sh):

>
    #!/bin/sh
    PAGER="col -b | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' - "
    export PAGER
    man $*
<

and then do 'vman ls' or whatever. Replace PAGER with MANPAGER if your man 
supports it and you want to use the script.

3. You might want to add ignorecase to the list of settings passed to Vim 
(view) to more closely match the searching of most man pagers (less and more).

==============================================================================

Even simpler way

What I did was:

1) renamed my less to less.orig2) edited the less.sh script :

>
    if test $# = 0; then
     vim -c 'so $VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.vim' -
    elif test $* = "-is"; then
     less.orig $*
    else
     vim -c 'so $VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.vim' $*
    fi
<

3) symlinked $VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.sh to /usb/bin/less

So as you can see when the man is called, it just passes the parameters to 
less.orig.

==============================================================================

On my Red Hat 7.2 system, view invokes vi (vim in vi compatibility mode), so 
extra Vim features such as syntax highlighting are not available. To use vim 
instead of vi for the pager, either manipulate the /bin/view link, or set 
substitute "vim -R" for "view".

==============================================================================

Replace view with less.sh of Vim will maintain the same keystrokes as less. 
The following set the MANPAGER for sh, ksh and bash:

>
    export MANPAGER="col -b | /usr/share/vim/vim61/macros/less.sh -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -"
<

==============================================================================

There's now a while-you're-in-vim solution -- check out script#489 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=489] for <Manpageview.vim> 
for a new :Man commandand support for the K normal-mode command.

==============================================================================

Using MANPAGER doesn't work so well with script#489 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=489]instead, I now use a 
Korn shell function. Similarfunctions could be developed for other shells 
(bash, zsh),I'm sure:

>
    # man:
    function man
    {
    /usr/bin/man $* | col -b | /usr/local/bin/view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -
    }
<

==============================================================================

I have done the following to make Vim work as my PAGER and it works really 
well. Like other people in this thread my man(1) doesn't use MANPAGER, it uses 
PAGER. I had trouble with vim's filetype autodetection picking up that it was 
indeed a manpage coming in over the pipe, so I've written a scripts.vim to 
match manpages by regex and set the filetype accordingly. Otherwise, I got no 
syntax highlighting. The shell I quote is tcsh-specific, but easily portable 
to another shell. Also, I assume you already have a ~/bin and that it is in 
your path and that you already have a ~/.vim. If not, you will need to do 
these things.

>
    % ln -s /path/to/VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.sh ~/bin/vless
    % cat >> ~/.vim/scripts.vim
    if did_filetype()
        finish
    endif
    if getline(1) =~ '^\(.\+\)(\d\{1}).\+\1(\d\{1})$'
        set filetype=man
    endif
    ^D
    % cat >> .cshrc
    # config pager
    if (-X vless && -X col) then
        setenv PAGER 'col -b | vless'
        alias less vless
        alias more vless
    else if (-X less) then
        setenv PAGER less
        setenv LESS "-e"
        alias more less
    else if (-X more) then
        setenv PAGER more
    else
        echo "WARNING: No pager found, PAGER not set."
    endif
    ^D
<

==============================================================================

Actually, here's a smarter way to do that scripts.vim (the original was taken 
from the Vim manual |new-filetypes-scripts|):

>
    if did_filetype() " filetype already set..
    elseif getline(1) =~ '^\(.\+\)(\d\{1}).\+\1(\d\{1})$'
     set filetype=man
    endif
<

The previous example works but wouldn't allow you to add anything else to 
your scripts.vim.

==============================================================================

I've been using brandon's little script for a while but I modified it with 
the help of this little sh script:

>
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # timball
    
    MAN=/usr/bin/man
    
    {
     if [ $1 = "-k" ]; then
     $MAN -k $2
     exit
     else
     if [ $TERM = "screen" ]; then
     screen $MAN -P "col -b | view -R --noplugin -u ~/lib/vim/vman.vim -" $1
     exit
     else
     $MAN -P "col -b | view -R --noplugin -u ~/lib/vim/vman.vim -" $1
     exit
     fi
     fi
    
    }
<

==============================================================================

To avoid the problems with Vim in the PAGER or MANPAGER variable, use the 
following bash-function:

>
    vman() { man $* | col -b | vim -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -; }
<

If you view a manpage within Vim now, the K-button will work right.

==============================================================================

In bash, adding:

>
    alias man='vman'
<

... after the vman function, in your .bashrc file, will let you use the man 
command again. Simply renaming the vman function to 'man' gave me a string of 
errors.

==============================================================================

When using UTF-8 as your locale, bad things happen. So this is how to make it 
work:

>
    function man {
     /usr/bin/man $* | col -bp | iconv -c | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -
    }
<

==============================================================================

If MANPAGER does not work and PAGER should not be used for the aforementioned 
good reasons then the lucky ones with GNU man simply write (csh)

>
    alias man
    '/usr/bin/man -P "col -bp | iconv -c | view -c '"'"'set ft=man nomod nolist'"'"' -" \!*'
    
    (this is tick-quotes-tick-quotes-tick in the middle) resp. (sh)
    
     alias man="/usr/bin/man -P \"col -bp | iconv -c | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -\""
    
    and the ones without write (csh)
    
     alias man 'env PAGER="col -bp | iconv -c | view -c '"'"'set ft=man nomod nolist'"'"' -" man \!*'
    
    resp. (sh)
    
     alias man="env PAGER=\"col -bp | iconv -c | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -\" /usr/bin/man"
    
    and are done.
<

==============================================================================

And with the SunOS 5 man(1) from SunOS 5 it is:

>
    alias man 'env PAGER="( col -bp | view -c '"'"'set ft=man nomod nolist'"'"' - ) < " /usr/bin/man \!*'
<

(and analogously for sh)since this man(1) calls PAGER with the name of a 
temporary file...

==============================================================================

If you are following Kerosin's advice above, make sure you use "/usr/bin/man" 
instead of just "man" so you won't get circular aliasing. That bug brought my 
machine to it's knees.

>
    vman() { /usr/bin/man $* | col -b | vim -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -; }
    alias man='vman'
<

==============================================================================

Nice. I added this little tidbit "-c 'nmap q :q<CR>'" so that I can quit with 
one keystroke like I did in the old days with less...

>
    vman() { /usr/bin/man $* | col -b | vim -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -c 'nmap q :q<CR>' -; }
    alias man='vman'
<

==============================================================================

There's probably more than one way to handle this, but instead of calling all 
sorts of bits'n'pieces I prefer this:

>
    # call Vim, ensure that ftplugin/man.vim is loaded, call Man with default manpage=man if no args, make sure this is only window
    function vman ()
    {
     vim -c "runtime ftplugin/man.vim" -c "Man ${1-man}" +"wincmd o"
    }
<

==============================================================================

One may also use manpageview script#489 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=489] in a like manner:

>
    function man
    {
    vim -c "Man $*" -c only
    }
<

==============================================================================

For those who have g:manpageview_winopen="only", a preferred way to get 
command line man is to:

>
    vim -c "Man $*" -c "silent! only".
<

Avoids a "Already only one window" message.

==============================================================================

When using the shell function described above, you launch Vim even when there 
is no man pages for the words you typed.The following code will correct that:

>
    vman() {
     if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
     /usr/bin/man
     elif whatis $* ; then
     /usr/bin/man $* | col -b | vim -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -
     fi
    }
    alias man='vman'
<

==============================================================================

This does not work on Debian and Ubuntu Linux systems, but it is trivial to 
fix.Technically, PAGER and MANPAGER are not guaranteed to be passed to a 
shell, soyou don't know that the pipe from 'col' to 'view' would work. On some 
systems PAGERis run under a shell, but on others PAGER is executed directly 
like any external command.The trick is to add a /bin/sh to make sure that the 
pipe gets interpreted.This works on almost any Linux flavor:

>
    export PAGER="/bin/sh -c \"col -b | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -\""
<

==============================================================================

Yet another variant. Together with manpageview script I'm using the following 
function for bash.

>
    function man
    {
     /usr/bin/whatis "$@" >/dev/null
    
     if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
     vim -c "Man $*" -c 'silent! only' -c 'nmap q :q<CR>'
     else
     man "$@"
     fi
    }
<

Note. I had to modify "whatis" script so that it sets non-zero exit status 
when it found nothing appropriate.

==============================================================================

If you have a error like that ..

>
    Reformatting man(1), please wait...
    col: invalid option -- c
    usage: col [-bfhpx] [-l nline]
    man: command exited with status 256: /usr/bin/zsoelim /tmp/zmanGiFFlw | /usr/bin/tbl
    | /usr/bin/nroff -mandoc -rLL=89n -rLT=89n -Tutf8 | col -b | view -c set ft=man
    nomod nolist titlestring=MANPAGE -
<

then the solution is ... this $PAGER definition makes the assumption that 
it's passed to sh -c (you use pipes and quotes). The man manpage doesn't say 
that $PAGER is passed to sh -c, it says it will use $PAGER as the program to 
display the manual page.

I suggest you use:

>
    export PAGER="sh -c \"col -b | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist titlestring=MANPAGE' -\""
<

which explicitely calls sh -c to handle pipes and quotes in the expected way.

You may also use your own /usr/local/bin/pager with:

>
    #!/bin/sh
    
    col -b | view -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist titlestring=MANPAGE' -
    and with PAGER=/usr/local/bin/pager.
<

I am reassigning to man for the man manpage to be clarified withrespect to 
the way $PAGER is called.

==============================================================================

On OS X 10.5, using Terminal.app, append this to your ~/.bash_profile to use 
vi (Vim) as your MANPAGER.

>
    export MANPAGER='col -bx | vim -c ":set ft=man nonu nolist" -R -'
<

==============================================================================

You might want to add

>
    -c 'set nonumber'
<

in the export PAGER=... command in your .bashrc file.

    " In most plugins there is used:
    "
    " if exists("loaded_myplugin")
    "   finish
    " endif
    " let g:loaded_myplugin=1
    "
    " which takes some space and needs some effort to copy paste/ remember / type
    " and is easier to read (IMHO)
    "
    " I think
    " exec DontLoadTwice("myplugin")"
    " is much easier to use
    " put this into your .vimrc:
    " returns the well known if exists("..") then finish endif let g:..=1 code
    " use it this way: call DontLoadTwice("myscriptname")
    function DontLoadTwice(globalIdentifier)
      let dltcmd ="if exists(\"g:".a:globalIdentifier."\")\n"
      let dltcmd.=" finish\n"
      let dltcmd.="endif\n"
      let dltcmd.="let g:".a:globalIdentifier."=1\n"
      return dltcmd
    endfunction

Of course if you want to redistribute your script and others don't have this 
function you need to direct users to this tip, so not much gained then. Might 
be handy for your own quick and dirty scripts.

Note: let a.="abc" means let a=a."abc" (Vim 7).

For one thing, as you point out, not everybody will have this function 
defined, which would defeat the purpose of the exercise. For another, here is 
a simpler implementation of the same thing:

>
    function! DontLoadTwice( globalIdentifier )
      let result = ''
      if exists( 'g:' . a:globalIdentifier )
        let result = 'finish'
      else
        let g:{a:globalIdentifier} = 1
      endif
      return result
    endfunction
    execute DontLoadTwice( "myVar" )
<

It's a longer implementation, but I think it's simpler because it doesn't 
attempt to create a complicated expression to be executed, but rather simply 
returns the word 'finish' if we should quit.

==============================================================================

A plugin developed with this approach can't be easily redistributed. However, 
this can be worked around by using Vim 7's autoload plugins (as VimL library 
plugins). Instead of being defined in the vimrc, the function would be named 
my_libs#plugin#DontLoadTwice(), and defined in 
{rtp}/autoload/my_libs/plugin.vim.

Another approach would be to use a template expander plugin 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Automated_Text_Insertion]. For instance, 
µ-template comes with a template that recognizes whether the new .vim file is 
a plugin or a ftplugin, and proposes a default anti-reinclusion mecanism 
accordingly.

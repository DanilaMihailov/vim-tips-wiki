==============================================================================

Many times, the default syntax file for a given file type leaves something to 
be desired. For example, perhaps you edit a lot of perl code, and wish that 
there was pre-defined syntax folding that you could use.

Before you decide to hack the syntax file, or create additions in your 
after/syntax directory, be sure to check to make sure your desired behavior 
doesn't already exist as a configurable option in the default syntax file.

A good starting point would be to look up the help page on the syntax file. 
For our example, use :help |perl.vim|. Here you can see that you can:

>
    let perl_fold=1
<

and perl.vim will define the folding for you! Alternatively, you could open 
perl.vim directly from your install directory under "syntax". There, you would 
see the following:

>
    " The following parameters are available for tuning the
    " perl syntax highlighting, with defaults given:
    " ...
    " ...
    " unlet perl_fold
    " unlet perl_fold_blocks
    " ...
<

Regardless of how you find them, you can set values for these custom options 
in your vimrc, or in your own ftplugin directory, to run before the normal 
ftplugin for the filetype. See :help |ftplugin|.

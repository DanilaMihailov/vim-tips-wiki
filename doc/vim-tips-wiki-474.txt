==============================================================================

Before making the switch to Vim, I spent time in limbo using EMACS in viper 
mode (which is EMACS with vi emulation). Despite the vast improvements in most 
areas, there were a few things I missed from EMACS. One thing I really missed 
was the behavior of the . command, which always restored the cursor position.

For example, let's say I had the following:

>
    foo.some_method.each do { |x| puts x }
    foo.some_other_method(Time.now)
    foo.close()
<

and I wanted to change foo to bar. I would always use a cw and then the . 
command:

>
    cwbar<CR>j.j.
<

rather than making a substitute command which would make me worry about the 
range over which it should take place etc.

When making the switch to Vim, I was disconcerted because after the first . 
my cursor was at the end of the second 'bar'.

In fact I pretty much always wanted this behavior from '.', so this mapping 
helped me out:

>
    "make . not move the cursor
    noremap . mz.`z
<

I've since noticed this is just a special case of the tip *restore-position* 
in the help manual, but it took me a while to find out how to do this. One 
other former emacs/viper user also was searching for this. Hopefully this tip 
makes it easier for the next person to find who finally finds their way out of 
EMACS.

You can also use the following mapping, that doesn't modify the z mark

>
    noremap . .'^
<

==============================================================================

When changing the text you always have several ways of how to specify the 
text to change.

You can change a word by typing cw at the beginning of the word. However I 
would prefer ciw - using text objects.

It was the "dot" command that made me to start using text objects aw, iw, ap, 
ip, etc. :help |objects|

>You can also use the following mapping, that doesn't modify the z mark

<

Wouldn't this be:

>
    noremap . .`[
<

The backtick jumps the cursor to the correct column.

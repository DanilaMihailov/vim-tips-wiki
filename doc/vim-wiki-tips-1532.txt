==============================================================================

This tip will help resolve error messages E97, E483, E484, E485, and E810 
encountered on machines running MS Windows. These errors relate to the 
creation of, or reading of temporary files. See :help |E97|, :help |E483|, 
:help |E485|. Also see Fix error E97 Cannot create diffs under Windows 
|vwt-416|.

>
    *e97* Can't create diffs blah blah
    *e485* Can't read file blah blah
<

I've experienced these errors when trying to use the diff commands, or any 
shell commands being called via the :! or :r! commands.

That is,

>
    :r! sort blah blah blah %
    or
    :r! dir
    etc

GENERIC CAUSES  *vwt-1532-generic-causes*

To correct this problem you may need to change your environment variable for 
$TMP or $TEMP, to somewhere you have write access. You can do this in a couple 
of different ways.

>
    1. Use the Windows environment settings. Here is one method.
        - Right click "My Computer".
        - Choose "Properties".
        - Click the "Advanced" tab.
        - Click the "Environment Variables" button.
        - In the bottom window pane, scroll down to the TMP or
          TEMP variables and highlight them.
        - Then click the "Edit" button and change the path to
          the directory you want.
    2. Use Vim – much better!
        - Add the following to your _vimrc file:
          let $TMP="c:/tmp"
<

In both cases, you need to create the directory (for example, C:\tmp), and 
you need read and write permission in that directory.

Another possible cause, as mentioned at :help |E484| starting with Vim 
7.3.845, is bad escaping of shell commands. If you have any special characters 
in an external command, such as any of the characters ^&|<>() or space 
characters, you will probably need to escape them with the shellescape() 
function before passing them to an external command.

E303  *vwt-1532-e303*

A common cause for the specific E303 error on recent versions of Windows, is 
that Microsoft at some point moved the default value of %TEMP% and %TMP% to 
reside somewhere deep within the current user's home directory, and removed 
the previous default directory C:\Temp and C:\TMP. For some reason, Vim 
doesn't (as of 2013-03-07) use $TEMP or $TMP for the default value of the 
'directory' option. Fixing this is easy, just put this in your .vimrc:

set directory=.,$TMP,$TEMP

[http://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/detail?id=28] for current status of this 
issue.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1532-comments*

TO DO
    - This tip needs reworking. A reader could get the impression that the only cause for the specified errors is due to TMP.
    - Add a brief explanation of what the environment variables do.
    - Probably want reference to :help  |dos-temp-files|. Any others?
    - The title is not helpful because a reader would only search for this title if they already knew the cause of their problem.

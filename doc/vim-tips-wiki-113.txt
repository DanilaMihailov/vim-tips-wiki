I found script "translate.vim", but on Windows this will be probably 
difficult to run it (maybe with Cygwin is it possible). I've simpler solution 
of keymap for Vim interfacing to dictionary:

Must exist file with vocabulary (e.g. "an-cs.txt"), which is called for word 
under cursor. In 'normal' is only displayed window with translations, in 
'insert' is word under cursor deleted and is insert selected form of word from 
translantion window (select it by mouse and than press right button: It works 
fine on W2k). Key _F12_ is looking for "word", shifted _S-F12_ is looking for 
"pattern".

For windows is needed agrep, which is localy placed on

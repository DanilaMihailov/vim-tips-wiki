==============================================================================

A very useful feature of Vim is the ability to operate on "text objects", 
allowing you to delete a word with the cursor anywhere on the word, visually 
select a block of code from anywhere within the code, etc. with very little 
typing and no movement.

For example, to visually select a quoted string (with the quotes), type va". 
To change the entire contents of a () group (without changing the parentheses 
themselves), type ci(. See :help |text-objects| for more details.

Occasionally, however, you will come across a situation where what you want 
to act on is a well-defined object, but is not a Vim-defined text object. 
Examples of this include all text of the same indent level 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indent_text_object], or all text within a fold. 
Vim's excellent mapping tools allow you to simulate the behavior of text 
objects for behavior you define.

A text object has two behaviors that need to be defined: visual mode, where 
it will select the appropriate text, and as a motion for an operator. So, you 
will need to use both a vmap and an omap to get the full text-object behavior. 
As a simple example, we will use a text object for operating on "a fold".

We will start with visual mode, because it is simpler. We want to set the 
start of visual mode to the start of the fold, so we will first need to leave 
visual mode with <Esc> (because <Esc> will work no matter what the visual mode 
is) and then move the cursor to the start of the fold with [z. This command 
will fail if performed when already on the first line in a fold, so we need to 
wrap the command in :silent! normal! in order to continue the mapping even in 
the case of an error. Next, we need to re-enter visual mode. Folds are based 
on lines, so it makes most sense to enter visual line selection with V. The 
other option would be to use an <expr> mapping, and use the 'mode()' function 
to discover the visual mode, but this is inconsistent with the behavior of 
other text objects. Finally, we need to set the end of the visual selection to 
the end of the fold with ]z. The entire mapping looks like this (vnoremap is 
used to ensure we get the built-in functionality of all commands):

>
    vnoremap af :<C-U>silent! normal! [zV]z<CR>
<

Now that we have the visual mode mapping, we can actually use it to make our 
operator-pending mode mapping easier. Since a fold acts on entire lines, "a 
fold" should probably act on the entire fold (an "inner fold" is more open to 
interpretation...if it even makes sense). So, an easy way to accomplish an 
operation would be to visual line select the fold, then apply the operator. 
This can be done with:

>
    omap af :normal Vaf<CR>
<

Here, we use omap and :normal without a bang (!) in order to make sure we use 
the remapped version of visual selection.

With these two simple mappings, you will now be able to use af just like a 
normal text object to act on folded text! More complex applications such as an 
indent-level text object [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indent_text_object] may 
require a function call to accomplish, but the concept is the same. Map an 
appropriate visual mapping, and if possible, use it to simplify the operator 
mapping.

    - textobj-user [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2100] is a 
      library that assists in writing text objects. With a patch to the Vim source, 
      it can even handle things such as :help |o_v|. 
    - CountJump [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3130] allows to 
      create custom motions and text objects via repeated jumps; one only needs to 
      specify the begin and end patterns.

TO DO

Bugs:
    - Will select containing fold for nested folds if cursor is on first line of 
      fold. 
    - Cannot handle characterwise selection with o_v :help |o_v| 
    - Subsequent repetitions of the text-object do nothing. Should probably select 
      next fold level for consistency with other text objects like aB.

==============================================================================

Sometimes after viewing something, you want to see a hardcopy of it. Vim 
provides a command for this:

>
    :hardcopy
<

On Windows a typical printers dialog box is displayed. Once you OK that box, 
Vim sends the document off to the printer. I thought that was great! But how 
could I do it faster?

Shortly afterwards, I learned the comnmad:

>
    :ha
<

and that would do the exact same thing. Was there an even faster way to do 
that? The answer is yes. You can type:

>
    :ha!
<

and that will send it right off to the default printer wtihout a dialog box 
stopping you!

When I first learned of ":ha!" I smiled all day!

For systems other than Windows, these commands will work slightly 
differently. See the Docs for details.

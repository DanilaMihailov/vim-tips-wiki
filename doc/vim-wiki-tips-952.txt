==============================================================================

If you are using command line completion while showing matches ( etc.), often 
the display scrolls in such a way that at least part of the text in the 
buffers is not visible anymore. If you want to redraw the screen, you have the 
option of switching to the command-window, which will refresh the screen 
anyway, but the following shows a way to redraw the screen without needing to 
do that.

Install the genutils.vim script#197 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=197] plugin or just copy 
paste the GetVimCmdOutput() function into your vimrc, and create the following 
cmap:

>
    cnoremap <C-X><C-L> <C-R>=GetVimCmdOutput('redraw')<CR>
<

You can now type anytime on the command-line even in the middle of typing a 
new command. In normal mode you can always use directly so this is not needed, 
if you enter Ex mode through command (:help |gQ|), you can use this to quickly 
redraw the screen.

      finally

        if v:errmsg != ''

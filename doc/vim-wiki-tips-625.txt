==============================================================================

Guess what the most common word is in the C++ language? I wager it is 'cout'.

Interactive debuggers and logging libraries are all very well, but most of us 
still have in our debugging toolboxes the technique of adding short-lived 
statements to our programs whose only purpose is to help us figure out the bug 
currently occupying us by printing the value of a variable. If you find 
yourself often typing such statements they are worth optimizing for.

For example, strings in most languages are surrounded by double quotes which 
require an extra motion and keystroke for the left shift key. With my coding 
style I multiply that motion towards the shift key by 4-6 times per print 
statement and 10-100 print statements everyday. The result is to significant 
slow me down and bring me closer to the Home for the Aged Wrist. The analogous 
cout statement in c++ is even more egregious in this regard. Consider 
statements like the following that I frequently find myself typing:

>
    cout << "AAA: " << someVarName << ": " << someOtherVarName << "\n" ;
<

That's *12* times my left hand moves towards the shift key for *one* 
statement! Unacceptable. My solution is to remap keys to interchange '<' and 
',' as well as double quotes and single quotes. Rather than force myself to 
learn a new keyboard mapping within vim I cause the mappings to trigger in a 
context-sensitive manner, within only a cout statement, from the time I type 
'cout' to the time I type the ';' in the end.

Here's my code fragment to do this:

>
    function! CppSetupCout ()
      inoremap , <Space><<
      inoremap < ,
      inoremap ' "
      inoremap " '
      imap ; <Esc>:call CppResetCout ()<CR>a;
      map <Esc>, :call CppResetCout ()<CR>
      imap <Esc>, <C-o>:call CppResetCout ()<CR>
    endf
    
    function! CppResetCout ()
      iunmap ,
      iunmap <
      iunmap '
      iunmap "
      iunmap ;
      imap <Esc>, <C-o>:call CppSetupCout ()<CR>
      map <Esc>, :call CppSetupCout ()<CR>
    endfunction
    
    function! AuCpp ()
      inoremap cout <End><Esc>:call CppSetupCout ()<CR>acout <<
      imap <Esc>, <C-o>:call CppSetupCout ()<CR>
      map <Esc>, :call CppSetupCout ()<CR>
    endfunction
    
    autocmd FileType cpp call AuCpp()
<

Notice that I use <Esc>, (or Alt-,) to quickly toggle these mappings on or 
off in other situations.

For some other languages it's probably sufficient to simply switch single- 
and double-quotes. Java might call for switching '+' and '=' within 
system.out.println. Come to think of it:

>
    autocmd FileType java iabbrev sop system.out.println
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-625-comments*

My solution for C is the line in my vimrc:

>
    nmap _if ofprintf(0<C-d>stderr, "{%s} {%d} - \n", __FILE__, __LINE__);<Esc>F\i
<

so I type _if, and then start typing the error message I want. adding 
__FILE__ and __LINE__ is invaluable when I come to remove the debugging I have 
scattered across half a dozen files. the 0<C-d> is so that these debug 
statements aren't indented, which makes them easier to pick out visually and 
to remove.

==============================================================================

This is useful when you want to upgrade to the latest version of Vim but want 
the ability to easily switch back to an old version. I create a symbolic link 
called 'current' in my $VIM directory to whichever is my current install of 
Vim. You can create symbolic links to directories on NTFS with the linkd 
utility in the resource kit:

>
    C:\Program Files\Vim>linkd current vim70c
    C:\Program Files\Vim>dir
    30/03/2006 13:09 <JUNCTION> current
    07/02/2006 17:27 <DIR> vim63
    30/03/2006 09:38 <DIR> vim64
    30/03/2006 13:08 <DIR> vim70c
<

I make sure that all shortcuts and registry entries reference gvim as 
C:\Program Files\Vim\current\gvim.exe, and I can then easily move the current 
link around to switch versions.

Tip 848 applies to any OS: it relies on naming one version the "default" and having it in the PATH; other versions must be invoked with an explicit path.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1189-comments*

Look for "Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools". There is a Linkd.exe.

You could even make a batch file (in your path) for each of your versions 
that sets the link and then executes current/gvim.exe.

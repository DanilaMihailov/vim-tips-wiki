==============================================================================

If you include the "r" or "o" flag in the 'formatoptions' option (:help 'fo', 
:help |fo-table|) then the comment leader is inserted automatically when you 
start a new line in a comment. For example, in TeX the "%" character is the 
comment leader, and you might type

>
    % This is a tex file.
    % The comment leaders on all lines but the first were generated automatically.
    % This is the last line of the comment, but Vim will insert the comment leader on the next line.
    %
<

You can get rid of the comment leader (along with anything you may already 
have typed on the line) without affecting the indent, if any, by typing <C-U> 
while in Insert mode (in case you do this by accident, there are ways to undo 
it [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Recover_from_accidental_Ctrl-U]).

Related point: If you want to adjust the indent while in insert mode, you can 
use <C-D> (to decrease the indent) or <C-T> (to increase it). See :help 
|30.4|.

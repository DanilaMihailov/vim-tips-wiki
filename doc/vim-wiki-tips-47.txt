NORMAL-MODE COMMANDS                             *vwt-47-normal-mode-commands*

Swap the current character (the character under the cursor) with the next:

>
    xp
<

Swap the current character with the previous:

>
    Xp
<

Swap the current line with the next (but see below |vwt-47-mappings| for a 
better method):

>
    ddp
<

Swap the current line with the previous:

>
    ddkP or ddkkp
<

Swap the current word with the next (see note):

>
    dawwP
    dawelp
    hdeep                (works at start of first word, useful if your separators aren't spaces)
    "xdiwdwep"xp         (works with most punctuations too)
<

Swap the current word with the previous (see note):

>
    dawbP
<

Note: These swap-word techniques don't work with punctuation. Use the 
mappings below to more intelligently move words. However, for many more 
complex swaps, several plugins |vwt-47-related-plugins| are available which 
often do a better job.

MAPPINGS                                                     *vwt-47-mappings*

See moving lines up or down 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Moving_lines_up_or_down] for the best method to 
move lines.

To use `gc` to swap the current character with the next, without changing the 
cursor position:

>
    :nnoremap <silent> gc xph
<

To use `gw` to swap the current word with the next, without changing cursor 
position: (See note.)

>
    :nnoremap <silent> gw "_yiw:s/\(\%#\w\+\)\(\W\+\)\(\w\+\)/\3\2\1/<CR><c-o><c-l>:nohlsearch<CR>
    " This version will work across newlines:
    :nnoremap <silent> gw "_yiw:s/\(\%#\w\+\)\(\_W\+\)\(\w\+\)/\3\2\1/<CR><c-o><c-l>:nohlsearch<CR>
<

To use `gl` to swap the current word with the previous, keeping cursor on 
current word: (This feels like "pushing" the word to the left.) (See note.)

>
    :nnoremap <silent> gl "_yiw?\w\+\_W\+\%#<CR>:s/\(\%#\w\+\)\(\_W\+\)\(\w\+\)/\3\2\1/<CR><c-o><c-l>:nohlsearch<CR>
<

To use `gr` to swap the current word with the next, keeping cursor on current 
word: (This feels like "pushing" the word to the right.) (See note.)

>
    :nnoremap <silent> gr "_yiw:s/\(\%#\w\+\)\(\_W\+\)\(\w\+\)/\3\2\1/<CR><c-o>/\w\+\_W\+<CR><c-l>:nohlsearch<CR>
<

To use `g{` to swap the current paragraph with the next:

>
    :nnoremap g{ {dap}p{
<

Note: Mappings above which perform a search-and-replace (ones containing 
`:s//`) will operate incorrectly on words with accented characters. To adjust 
the mappings above to work with your locale, replace all `\w` with [alphabet] 
and `\W` with `[^alphabet]`, where alphabet is the set of characters in your 
alphabet. :help |/\w|

For ISO/IEC_8859-1 Latin-1 Supplement characters, substitute all `\w` 
instances with `[0-9A-Za-zÀ-ÖØ-öø-ÿ_]` and all `\_W` instances with 
`\_[^0-9A-Za-zÀ-ÖØ-öø-ÿ_]`.

VISUAL-MODE SWAPPING                             *vwt-47-visual-mode-swapping*

To use this mapping: first, delete some text (using a command such as `daw` 
or `dt` in normal mode, or `x` in visual mode). Then, use visual mode to 
select some other text, and press Ctrl-X. The two pieces of text should then 
be swapped.

SWAP ALL LINES IN A VISUAL SELECTED BLOCK *vwt-47-swap-all-lines-in-a-visual-selected-block*

When working with arrays I sometimes realize that I have to do things inthe 
opposite order. To easily change this I created this small function:

>
    function SwapAll() range
      if a:firstline != a:lastline
        if a:firstline < a:lastline
          let first=a:firstline
          let last=a:lastline
        else
          let first=a:lastline
          let last=a:firstline
        endif
        while first < last
          exec first.'m'.last.'|'.(last-1).'m'.(first-1)
          let first=first+1
          let last=last-1
        endwhile
      endif
    endfunction
    
    vmap     <silent> <C-s>   :call SwapAll()<CR>
    vnoremap <silent> <C-x>   :call SwapAll()<CR>

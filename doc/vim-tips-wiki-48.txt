movement commands. In most cases the cursor keys are not the best choice.

Here are some basic movement commands that may help you acquire a taste for 
more:

e  Move to the end of a word.

w  Move forward to the beginning of a word.

3w  Move forward three words.

W  Move forward a WORD (any non-whitespace characters).

b  Move backward to the beginning of a word.

3b  Move backward three words.

$  Move to the end of the line.

0  Move to the beginning of the line.

^  Move to the first non-blank character of the line.

)  Jump forward one sentence.

(  Jump backward one sentence.

}  Jump forward one paragraph.

{  Jump backward one paragraph.

 (Two back ticks. This is above the Tab key on some keyboards.)

'.  Jump to the last-changed line.

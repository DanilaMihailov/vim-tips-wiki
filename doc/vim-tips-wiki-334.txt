==============================================================================

If you copy your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] to many places, 
you might get a problem. Writing a portable vimrc is sometimes painful. Maybe 
in some places you have latest Vim 6.1, and in some places you have Vim 5.x. 
And maybe you have some favorite scripts in your own computer while other 
places does not.

Here're some tips and examples on writing portable vimrc that will not make 
error messages when environment changes:

(1) Check version:

>
    if version >= 600
     set foldcolumn=2
    endif
<

Note: version 6.1 would be 601

(2) Use environment variables:

>
    source $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim
<

(3) Loading scripts(especially useful for scripts just merged into standard 
macros):

>
    if filereadable($VIMRUNTIME . "/macros/matchit.vim")
     source $VIMRUNTIME/macros/matchit.vim
    endif
<

Regarding sourcing stuff inside the runtime directory such as the macros 
stuff, look at the :runtime command -- it doesn't require error checking 
(though it might be only for 6.x or above so pop it inside the version check).

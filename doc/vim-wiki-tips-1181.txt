==============================================================================

Have you ever wished that you could compare a text file on your Windows 
machine with one on your FreeBSD/Redhat box? Now you can!

In addition to Vim, you'll need PSCP (which you can download from 
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html 
[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html]) and 
diff.exe. If you are using Pageant you will not even have to worry about 
passwords.

Add to your vimrc:

>
    " paj using PSCP on Windows. Works best with Pageant.
    if ($OS =~ "Windows")
      let g:netrw_scp_cmd="\"c:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\pscp.exe\" -q -batch"
    endif
    C:\>vim -d \path\to\vimfiles\colors\primitive.vim scp://user@my.host/path/to/.vim/colors/primitive.vim
<

REFERENCES                                               *vwt-1181-references*
    - :help |scp|

This doesn't seem to work for me because pscp seems to put the remote host 
'foo@bar.com:/dir' in single quotes. Then the command line fails.

Is there any way to force netrw not to use single quotes in the command line?

==============================================================================

Looks like the single quotes is added only in vim 7.0, when I switched back 
to 6.2 it works.

==============================================================================

There's a hack I found on Google which makes pscp work with Vim 7:

In the netrw.vim file (normally vim70/autoload/netrw.vim), search for the 
following line (normally line 557) and remove single quotes:

>
    exe g:netrw_silentxfer."!".g:netrw_scp_cmd.useport." '".g:netrw_machine.":".escape(b:netrw_fname,g:netrw_fname_escape)."' ".tmpfile
<

TO DO Has this been fixed in the current netrw?

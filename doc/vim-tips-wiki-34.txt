==============================================================================

There are a few ways to open a new window (:help |opening-window|), but some 
users may not like the placement of this new window. By default, Vim opens the 
new window above the current one for horizontal splits, and to the left of the 
current one for vertical splits. You can customize this behavior like most 
other things in Vim:

>
    :set splitbelow
<

make the new window appear below the current window.

>
    :set splitright
<

make the new window appear on the right.

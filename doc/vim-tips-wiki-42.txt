==============================================================================

A mark allows you to record your current position so you can return to it 
later. There is no visible indication of where marks are set.

Each file has a set of marks identified by lowercase letters (a-z). In 
addition there is a global set of marks identified by uppercase letters (A-Z) 
that identify a position within a particular file. For example, you may be 
editing ten files. Each file could have mark a, but only one file can have 
mark A.

Because of their limitations, uppercase marks may at first glance seem less 
versatile than their lowercase counterpart, but this feature allows them to be 
used as a quick sort of "file bookmark." For example, open your .vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], press `mV`, and close Vim. The next time 
you want to edit your .vimrc, just press 'V to open it. This assumes that you 
have kept the default 'viminfo' behavior, so that uppercase marks are all 
remembered in the |viminfo-file| between Vim sessions.

As well as the letter marks, there are various special marks.

The marks for recently-edited files are saved (provided the 'viminfo' option 
has the ' parameter), so marks from previous sessions can be used when editing 
in the future. :help 'viminfo'

SETTING MARKS                                           *vtw-42-setting-marks*

To set a mark, type `m` followed by a letter. For example, `ma` sets mark a 
at the current position (line and column). If you set mark a, any mark in the 
current file that was previously identified as a is removed. If you set mark 
A, any previous mark A (in any file) is removed.

USING MARKS                                               *vtw-42-using-marks*

To jump to a mark enter an apostrophe (') or backtick (```) followed by a 
letter. Using an apostrophe jumps to the beginning of the line holding the 
mark, while a backtick jumps to the line and column of the mark.

Using a lowercase letter (for example ``a`) will only work if that mark 
exists in the current buffer. Using an uppercase letter (for example ``A`) 
will jump to the file and the position holding the mark (you do not need to 
open the file prior to jumping to the mark).
    - Each file can have mark a – use a lowercase mark to jump within a file. 
    - There is only one file mark A – use an uppercase mark to jump between files. 


Commands like d'a operate "linewise" and include the start and end 
lines.Commands like `d`a` operate "characterwise" and include the start but 
not the end character.

It is possible to navigate between lowercase marks:

The above commands take a count. For example, `5]`` jumps to the fifth mark 
after the cursor.

SPECIAL MARKS                                           *vtw-42-special-marks*

Vim has some special marks which it sets automatically. Here are some of the 
most useful:

DELETING MARKS                                         *vtw-42-deleting-marks*

If you delete a line containing a mark, the mark is also deleted.

If you wipeout a buffer (command `:bw`), all marks for the buffer are 
deleted.

The `:delmarks` command (abbreviated as `:delm`) may be used to delete 
specified marks.

    - showmarks [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152] plugin to 
      put a sign in the left margin for each mark; works poorly and interferes with 
      other commands in Vim 7 (updated version working in 7.4 here: [1]

COMMENTS                                                     *vtw-42-comments*

The `:delmarks` command requires Vim 7.0. On previous versions, a kludge to 
remove all marks is to enter the command `:%!cat` (on Unix-based systems), or 
`:%!type` (on Windows) to delete the entire contents of the buffer and replace 
each line with itself by filtering through an external command. A mark is 
automatically deleted when its line is deleted.

==============================================================================

I suggest moving the Deleting section below the Using section. (Spiiph

I was scratching my head wondering why I put them in their current order, but when I went to move it, I see why. It's nice that "Using" and "Special" can be seen together, on the same screen because they are the items that a reader will probably want to refer to (it's a bit hard to keep all of it in your mind). I suppose "Deleting" could go after "Special", but that might be as strange as where it is now? JohnBeckett 23:34, 30 July 2009 (UTC)
I think that would be better, even though it might seem illogical. Another idea would be to remove the section on Deleting marks altogether. I don't think I have ever used that functionality, and users who need it are probably advanced enough to find the information in the :help. (Spiiph 13:39, 2 August 2009 (UTC))
Done.

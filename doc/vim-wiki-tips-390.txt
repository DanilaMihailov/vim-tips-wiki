I like using vim's diff mode for comparing different revisions of source code 
files. usually older versions do not live in the directory structure with the 
current versions, but in a cvs repository. the command below, CVSdiff, can 
compare the current file to any given revision number in the cvs repository. 
please note that in case a revision number does not exist, empty files will be 
displayed, as the below script does not do any error checking (yep, i'm lazy, 
and this works for me). a vertical split is performed on the current file and 
its given previous revision.

    command -nargs=1 CVSdiff silent call CVSdiff("%", "<args>")
    function! CVSdiff(filename, cvsversion)
      " append a:filename to keep extension and therefore highlighting mode
      let patchname = tempname() . a:filename
      let tempname = tempname() . a:filename
      let newname = tempname() . a:filename
      execute "!cvs diff -a -r " . a:cvsversion . " " . a:filename . " > " . patch
      execute "!cp " . a:filename . " " . tempname
      execute "!patch -R -o " . newname . " " . tempname . " < " . patchname
      execute "vertical diffsplit " . newname
      call delete(patchname)
      call delete(tempname)
      call delete(newname)
    endfunction

See script#58 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=58]. It is 
very useful.

==============================================================================

I use script#90 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90] 
(cvscommand.vim).

There is a little error of this tip, and I believe it is just a typo.

line 7:

>
    execute "!cvs diff -a -r " . a:cvsversion . " " . a:filename . " > " . patch
<

'patch' should be corrected to 'patchname'.

==============================================================================

I've written a shellscript "cvsvimdiff", it is available 
here:http://www.bononia.it/~zack/myprograms.en.html 
[http://www.bononia.it/~zack/myprograms.en.html]Direct link to the 
script:http://www.bononia.it/~zack/stuff/cvsvimdiff 
[http://www.bononia.it/~zack/stuff/cvsvimdiff]

It can be used as you use "cvs diff", but it spawns a vimdiff process to 
examine the differences.

Same idea of this tip, but I find it more handy since you usually need to 
review diffs during a shell session, just after "cvs update".

==============================================================================

You are about the modify an important file. You want to save this original 
fileunder a different name (and keep the file view). Quick, think of a new 
name-- oh, time wasted, for you could have quickly typed in ";s" and got 
backto the modification at hand.

>
    map ;s :up \| saveas! %:p:r-<C-R>=strftime("%y%m%d")<CR>-bak.txt \| 3sleep \| e #<CR>
    " Dated-BAKUP date number format, re-edit original
    " first update, else changes get lost on re-edit,
    " saves view (attn: write alone does not save view)
    " thus better than generic copy at OS level,
    " but be careful when split editing
<

The above saves the original file with a date-stamp as part of the filename. 
Note that it overwrites throughout a single day. If you want a more narrow 
period of time for overwrites, then supplement above map with hour, min, or 
seconds. The 3sleep is there just to visually verify that the save has taken 
place.

I modified a little:

>
    map ;s :up \| saveas! %:p:r-<C-R>=strftime("%y%m%d-%H:%M")<CR>-bak.<C-R>=expand("%:e")<CR> \| 3sleep \| e #<CR>
<

this save's the original file extension ( so you have the same syntax 
highlighting when openning the backup)

==============================================================================

Here's my mapping to work on a temp copy:

>
    :map zs :exe "sav $TMP/" . expand("%:t") . strftime("-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S")<CR>
<

==============================================================================

Unfortunately this tip interferes with MRU.vim script#521 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=521].

==============================================================================

If you don't want the backup files in the MRU, try using `:w! {file}`

instead of `:sav! {file} \| :e`

Using `:w[rite]` with a filename writes the new file, but doesn't change the 
name of the buffer.

check also :file for buffer name problems

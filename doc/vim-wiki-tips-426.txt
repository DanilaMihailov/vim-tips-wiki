==============================================================================

A common programmimg situation, you are comparing two versions of the same 
file. One is the "reference file" which you don't want to update. However they 
look so similar that you can get confused.

Solution: Set the master file to read only, and change its color scheme.

>
    :set nomodifiable
    :colorscheme peachpuff
<

Non-modifiable is better than :set ro as nomodifiable won't even let you 
start changing stuff, whereas :set ro will only warn you once.

COMMENTS  *vwt-426-comments*

You can permanently protect a file by setting a suitable modeline :help 
|modeline|.

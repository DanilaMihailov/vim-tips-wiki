==============================================================================

Register `%` contains the name of the current file, and register `#` contains 
the name of the alternate file. These registers allow the name of the current 
or alternate files to be displayed or inserted. The name, or full path, or 
directory containing the file can be used.

For example, in directory `/abc` the command `vim def/my.txt` would edit file 
`/abc/def/my.txt`. The following commands could be entered to display the 
information shown.

For more info run `:help expand`

If all that is wanted is to display the name of the current file, type Ctrl-G 
(or press `1` then Ctrl-G for the full path).

When using `@%`, the name is displayed relative to the current directory.

In insert mode, type Ctrl-R then `%` to insert the name of the current file.

In command mode (after typing a colon), type Ctrl-R then `%` to insert the 
name of the current file. The inserted name can then be edited to create a 
similar name.

In normal mode, type `"%p` to put the name of the current file after the 
cursor (or `"%P` to insert the name before the cursor).

The following commands insert lines consisting of the full path of the 
current and alternate files into the buffer:

>
    :put =expand('%:p')
    :put =expand('#:p')
<

If you need to insert other file names (say the *.h name in an #include), you 
can do C-X+C-F for filename completion.

Hey quick question, Ctrl-G worked but I'm wondering if there is a special way 
to examine the contents of the % register? According to :help |@|

>
    @{0-9a-z".=*}
    Execute the contents of register {0-9a-z".=*} [count] times.
    Note that register '%' (name of the current file) and
    '#' (name of the alternate file) cannot be used.
<

Is there a special way to echo its contents?

I have edited the tip to clarify several points, including the above. That help is for executing registers and does not apply when a register is displayed or inserted. JohnBeckett 03:06, November 11, 2011 (UTC)

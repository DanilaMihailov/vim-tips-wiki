==============================================================================

To easily save the current file, while keeping it open, use a mapping in your 
vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    noremap <Leader>s :update<CR>
<

With the default leader key, just press `\s` to save any changes to the 
current file. If the buffer has not been modified since the last save, the 
file is not written.

On many Windows systems, the file mswin.vim is sourced when Vim starts. In 
that case, Ctrl-S is mapped to `:update`, so the above mapping is not 
necessary (press Ctrl-S to save).

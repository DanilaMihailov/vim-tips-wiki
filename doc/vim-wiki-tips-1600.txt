==============================================================================

When using most tabbed editors, if you open a file for editing, and the file 
is already open in another tab, the editor will simply jump to that tab. There 
are very good reasons that Vim does not act this way, which are too numerous 
to go into detail about here – suffice it to say that there are many excellent 
features in Vim that would not be possible if it acted like "most tabbed 
editors". Nevertheless, it would be nice if Vim had this functionality when 
the user wishes to use it.

It turns out, Vim does have this functionality, but it is hard to find.

The :drop command will edit a new file, or jump to the window containing it 
if it already exists. Using :tab with it (i.e. :tab drop {file}) will open the 
file in a new tab if it isn't already open.

Dragging and dropping a file into gvim automatically invokes the :drop 
command. If you hold down the CTRL key while doing this, it will force a 
window to split (there isn't a way to force a tab, but CTRL-W T right 
afterwards will do that for you easily). If you hold down SHIFT, it will set 
Vim's working directory to that of the file.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1600-comments*

You can use :command! -nargs=1 -complete=file O tab drop <args> to open the 
file or jump to it using :O FILENAME.

Here is a powershell script I use to run gvim for me. If the file is already 
open in another window, it opens that instead; otherwise, it just open it 
normally:

>
    function Show-Process($Process, [Switch]$Maximize)
    {
      $sig = '
        [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow);
        [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern int SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hwnd);
      '
      
    
      if ($Maximize) { $Mode = 3 } else { $Mode = 4 }
      $type = Add-Type -MemberDefinition $sig -Name WindowAPI -PassThru
      $hwnd = $process.MainWindowHandle
      $null = $type::ShowWindowAsync($hwnd, $Mode)
      $null = $type::SetForegroundWindow($hwnd) 
    }
    
    function Find-File {
        [cmdletbinding()]
            param (
                [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline=$true)]
                [string]$File
            )
        $b = $(gci -Attributes Hidden | where { $_.Name -match "^\.$File\.sw" })
        if ($b) {
            $openWindow = $(Get-Process | `
                Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -match "^$File .* - GVIM$" })
            if ($openWindow) {
                Show-Process $openWindow
            } else {
                gvim $File
            }
        } else {
            gvim $File
        }
    }

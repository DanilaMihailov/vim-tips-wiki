==============================================================================

Vim has a very functional built-in formatter (:help |formatting|), but for 
raw formatting power nothing beats the Berkeley program 'par'. It can format, 
justify, align, slice and dice using a bewildering array of options. See 
http://www.nicemice.net/par/ [http://www.nicemice.net/par/]

To use:

Either :set equalprg=par and format using the magic '=', or assign to a key 
combination by putting the following in your vimrc (-j is to justify lines):

>
    :set formatprg=par\ -w60
    :map <A-q> {v}!par -jw60<CR>
    :vmap <A-q> !par -jw60<CR>
<

Select a region and press <A-q> to format.

Here are a few examples from the 'par' docs. See the current par page 
[http://www.nicemice.net/par/] for more.

Before:

>
    /*   We the people of the United States, */
    /* in order to form a more perfect union, */
    /* establish justice, */
    /* insure domestic tranquility, */
    /* provide for the common defense, */
    /* promote the general welfare, */
    /* and secure the blessing of liberty */
    /* to ourselves and our posterity, */
    /* do ordain and establish the Constitution */
    /* of the United States of America. */
<

After "par 59":

>
    /*   We the people of the United States, in      */
    /* order to form a more perfect union, establish */
    /* justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide */
    /* for the common defense, promote the general   */
    /* welfare, and secure the blessing of liberty   */
    /* to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain     */
    /* and establish the Constitution of the United  */
    /* States of America.                            */

UNICODE  *vwt-584-unicode*

Note that 'par' doesn't handle Unicode correctly. There is a patch which adds 
multibyte support 
[http://sysmic.org/dotclear/index.php?2006/06/22/55-add-multibyte-characters-support-in-par], 
(though at least the 'e' option is known not to work correctly as of Dec 
2006).

A workaround, using an unpatched 'par' is:

>
    cat <file> | iconv -f utf-8 -t <encoding> | par <options> | iconv -f <encoding> -t utf-8
<

replace <file> with filename, <encoding> with the single byte encoding that 
can represent the document. If the document is written in greek it is 
iso-8859-7 if it is east europe iso-8859-2 etc. Replace <options> with the par 
options you wish to use.

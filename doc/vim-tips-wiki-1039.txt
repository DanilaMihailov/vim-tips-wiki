This tip discusses automatic indenting of text that may occur while you are 
typing, and explains how to disable such automatic indentation.

For a general discussion of indenting, see Indenting source code |vtw-83|.

If you use Vim in a terminal, you may find that pasting from another 
application changes the indents in the pasted text. See Toggle auto-indenting 
for code paste |vtw-906| to deal with that problem.

DISABLING FILE TYPE BASED INDENTATION FOR A SPECIFIC FILE TYPE *vtw-1039-disabling-file-type-based-indentation-for-a-specific-file-type*

You may like auto indenting in C programs, but dislike it when editing html 
files. You can disable auto indentation for particular files types; the 
following example shows how to do this for html files.

Create the file `~/.vim/indent/html.vim` on Unix-based systems, or 
`$HOME/vimfiles/indent/html.vim` on Windows systems, containing the single 
line:

>
    let b:did_indent = 1
<

This creates a user-specific indent script which will be loaded before the 
file type indent script. Auto indenting for the particular file type is 
disabled because well-behaved indent scripts do nothing if the buffer-local 
variable `b:did_indent` is defined (that variable indicates that the current 
buffer already has script-based indenting enabled).

You need to use the correct name for the file type (`html` in the above). If 
you are not sure what that name is, edit a file where you want to remove auto 
indentation (for example, `my.htm`), then enter the following command to 
display the value of the `ft` (`filetype`) option for the current buffer:

>
    :set ft?
<

DISABLING FILE TYPE BASED INDENTATION FOR ALL FILE TYPES *vtw-1039-disabling-file-type-based-indentation-for-all-file-types*

The auto indentation provided for most languages is very helpful, and you 
should consider trying it. However, it's easy to disable all auto indents if 
wanted.

Actually, auto indentation is off by default, and if it is enabled on your 
system, that is because something has enabled it. For example, your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] may contain:

>
    filetype indent plugin on
<

or

>
    filetype indent on
<

If you remove the `indent` keyword, none of your files will have file type 
based indentation rules applied.

However, the `filetype indent plugin on` command may be included in a 
system-wide vimrc (:help |system-vimrc|), or in the file `vimrc_example.vim` 
sourced from your vimrc. For either of these cases, put the following near the 
bottom of your vimrc to disable filetype based indentation:

>
    filetype indent off
<

DISABLING AUTO INDENT FOR THE CURRENT FILE *vtw-1039-disabling-auto-indent-for-the-current-file*

To see the current indenting settings, and where they were set, enter:

>
    :verbose set ai? cin? cink? cino? si? inde? indk?
<

If you are editing a particular file and you want to prevent auto indenting 
within that file, enter:

>
    :setlocal noautoindent
    :setlocal nocindent
    :setlocal nosmartindent
    :setlocal indentexpr=
<

The following is equivalent (it uses the abbreviated names in a single 
command):

>
    :setl noai nocin nosi inde=
<

Here is a mapping so you can press F8 to disable auto indenting:

>
    :nnoremap <F8> :setl noai nocin nosi inde=<CR>
<

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1039-comments*

You may have disabled auto indenting in HTML files, but you would like auto 
indenting of your embedded PHP code. When wanted, enter the following to 
toggle the `smartindent` option, and show its current value:

>
    :setl si! si?
<

Note that while 'smartindent' works decently for PHP, filetype indentation usually works better, even in this case. I think that -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- setting ft=php should offer indentation for PHP while leaving the HTML alone. See :help 'filetype', and also VimTip1213.

==============================================================================

(update - add this to your vimrc to block the autoindenting of comments - no 
other solution on this page works):-

>
    autocmd FileType * setlocal formatoptions-=c formatoptions-=r formatoptions-=o
<

Presumably this refers to the comment leaders inserted automatically by Vim. This is not indentation. Indentation refers to whitespace only. See the following for your problem with comment leaders, or do a search yourself for "comment leader" on the wiki or elsewhere:
Removing automatic comment leaders
Disable automatic comment insertion
Insert a non commented line despite formatoptions

DISABLING AUTO INDENT TEMPORARILY TO PASTE *vtw-1039-disabling-auto-indent-temporarily-to-paste*

Sometimes you only need to paste some snippet of code, that already has 
indentation, so you can disable it only during the paste operation:

>
    :set paste
<

then

>
    :set nopaste
<

The introduction at the top mentions "See Toggle auto-indenting for code paste" and that tip has the correct way to do this. You don't need the above set commands. JohnBeckett (talk) 11:30, February 8, 2013 (UTC)

GLOBALLY DISABLE AUTO-INDENTATION BY DISABLING THE FILE *vtw-1039-globally-disable-auto-indentation-by-disabling-the-file*

>
    cd /usr/share/vim/vim80
    
    cp indent.vim indent.vim.bak
<

`indent.vim` in the Vim directory (vim80 for the latest version of Vim)

is THE file which sources `indent/` directory (located in /usr/share/vim80 
and being indent.vim's sibling node)

which contains *filetype*.vim files (eg. `sh.vim`) who set `indentexpr` 
option (eg to `GetShIndent()`).

to trigger based on filetypes of opened files.

Why do it this way, when you can just turn off filetype indentation rules in your .vimrc? this way you affect all users on the system and there is no easy way to turn back on filetype indentation, even temporarily, if desired. --Fritzophrenic (talk)

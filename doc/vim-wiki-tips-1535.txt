==============================================================================

Vim's find only accepts exact file names. It does not accept wild chars like 
* and **.

:next is good way to search for files in the current directory.

For example, if the current directory is d:/vim/reason,

>
    :next **/*Filter.java
<

searchs all the files in d:/vim directory recursively to find files whose 
names are suffixed with Filter.java.

:help |:next|

COMMENTS  *vwt-1535-comments*

TO DO
    - Explain the point of this tip, as opposed to using other tools that may be more suited to the task.
    - Can the built-in :Explore command be used?
    - Shouldn't the help be to :next_f rather than :next?
    - The "for example" is unnecessarily confusing. There is no reason to have an example with "vim" in the path. Also, delete the "d:" – it serves no purpose.
    - Does the command really search the parent directory like the words suggest?


==============================================================================

Is there a way to make it search the full path, and not just current 
directory?

ROUGH MERGE IN OF MATERIAL BY USER TALK:CHUCK FORBISH [HTTPS://VIM.FANDOM.COM/WIKI/USER_TALK:CHUCK_FORBISH]  *vwt-1535-rough-merge-in-of-material-by-user-talk:chuck-forbish-[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/user_talk:chuck_forbish]*

I use the following mappings to iterate through files in my argument list 
(:args).

>
    nmap <c-right> :n<CR>
    nmap <c-left> :N<CR>
<

Using control and an arrow key is much faster than typing ':cn<CR>'.

Similarly you can use the up and down arrows for going back and forth for the 
times there is more than one matching tag.

>
    nmap <C-Down> :tn<CR>
    nmap <C-Up> :tN<CR>
<

These key sequences support repeating if kept pressed.

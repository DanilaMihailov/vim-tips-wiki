==============================================================================

When editing a text file, if you want word wrapping, but only want line 
breaks inserted when you explicitly press the Enter key:

>
    :set wrap
    :set linebreak
    " :set nolist In vim versions prior to 7.4.353 list disabled linebreak
<

This will get Vim to wrap existing text as desired. wrap tells Vim to word 
wrap visually (as opposed to changing the text in the buffer), and linebreak 
tells Vim to only wrap at a character in the breakat option (by default, this 
includes " ^I!@*-+;:,./?" (note the inclusion of " " and that ^I is the 
control character for Tab)).

In addition, you will need to prevent Vim from automatically inserting line 
breaks in newly entered text. The easiest way to do this is:

>
    :set textwidth=0
    :set wrapmargin=0
<

If you want to keep your existing 'textwidth' settings for most lines in your 
file, but not have Vim automatically reformat when typing on existing lines, 
you can do this with:

>
    :set formatoptions-=t
<

If you want Vim to adjust textwidth automatically most of the time but you 
have a few long lines that you don't want to change, use:

>
    :set formatoptions+=l
<

To make settings permanent, without the need to type this every time you use 
Vim, just add the commands to your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

I'm not certain whether 'wrapmargin' is always turned off when it is set 
equal to zero, but it seems to work. Is this always the case?

I do not use wrapmargin but surely its meaning implies that it only does something when set to a value above zero. I think it's pretty safe to assume the tip is ok. JohnBeckett 11:32, June 16, 2010 (UTC)

This doesn't work. With the settings saved, I restarted vim and created a new 
file. If I hold down the "a" key and randomly press the space bar. Eventually 
vim still inserts line feed characters into the text. This is not a visual 
wrap, but the actual '\n' character. Which shouldn't happen. --October 2, 2012

==============================================================================

It can be useful to do a word wrap without line breaks only when editing text 
(not programming code), using LaTeX for example. I've added these lines in my 
.vimrc to reach this :

>
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt,*.tex set wrap linebreak nolist textwidth=0 wrapmargin=0
<

That works, but where possible, it is probably better to use the technique shown at Keep your vimrc file clean. JohnBeckett (talk) 07:01, February 9, 2013 (UTC)

==============================================================================

When editing a text file, if you want word wrapping, but only want line 
breaks inserted when you explicitly press the Enter key:

>
    :set wrap
    :set linebreak
    " :set nolist In vim versions prior to 7.4.353 list disabled linebreak
<

This will get Vim to wrap existing text as desired. `wrap` tells Vim to word 
wrap visually (as opposed to changing the text in the buffer), and `linebreak` 
tells Vim to only wrap at a character in the `breakat` option (by default, 
this includes "` ^I!@*-+;:,./?`" (note the inclusion of " " and that `^I` is 
the control character for Tab)).

In addition, you will need to prevent Vim from automatically inserting line 
breaks in newly entered text. The easiest way to do this is:

>
    :set textwidth=0
    :set wrapmargin=0
<

If you want to keep your existing 'textwidth' settings for most lines in your 
file, but not have Vim automatically reformat when typing on existing lines, 
you can do this with:

>
    :set formatoptions-=t
<

If you want Vim to adjust textwidth automatically most of the time but you 
have a few long lines that you don't want to change, use:

>
    :set formatoptions+=l
<

To make settings permanent, without the need to type this every time you use 
Vim, just add the commands to your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

I'm not certain whether 'wrapmargin' is always turned off when it is set 
equal to zero, but it seems to work. Is this always the case?

I do not use wrapmargin but surely its meaning implies that it only does something when set to a value above zero. I think it's pretty safe to assume the tip is ok. JohnBeckett 11:32, June 16, 2010 (UTC)

This doesn't work. With the settings saved, I restarted vim and created a new 
file. If I hold down the "a" key and randomly press the space bar. Eventually 
vim still inserts line feed characters into the text. This is not a visual 
wrap, but the actual '\n' character. Which shouldn't happen. --October 2, 2012

==============================================================================

It can be useful to do a word wrap without line breaks only when editing text 
(not programming code), using LaTeX for example. I've added these lines in my 
.vimrc to reach this :

>
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt,*.tex set wrap linebreak nolist textwidth=0 wrapmargin=0
<

That works, but where possible, it is probably better to use the technique shown at Keep your vimrc file clean. JohnBeckett (talk) 07:01, February 9, 2013 (UTC)

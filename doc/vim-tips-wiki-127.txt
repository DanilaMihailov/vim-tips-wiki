This tip shows how to use Vim to view an html file, or a web page, in a web 
browser. If wanted, a text-based web browser can be used to read the text from 
an html page into a scratch buffer in Vim.

VIEWING TEXT FROM AN HTML FILE OR A URL *vtw-127-viewing-text-from-an-html-file-or-a-url*

A text-based web browser such as elinks [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinks] 
can extract a formatted view of the text from an html file or a web page. The 
following shows how to use elinks to read that text into a scratch buffer. You 
might do that for a quick preview, or to copy text from the displayed html 
page.

>
    function! ViewHtmlText(url)
      if !empty(a:url)
        new
        setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide noswapfile
        execute 'r !elinks ' . a:url . ' -dump -dump-width ' . winwidth(0)
        1d
      endif
    endfunction
    " Save and view text for current html file.
    nnoremap <Leader>H :update<Bar>call ViewHtmlText(expand('%:p'))<CR>
    " View text for visually selected url.
    vnoremap <Leader>h y:call ViewHtmlText(@@)<CR>
    " View text for URL from clipboard.
    " On Linux, use @* for current selection or @+ for text in clipboard.
    nnoremap <Leader>h :call ViewHtmlText(@+)<CR>
<

After sourcing the above, and assuming the default backslash Leader key, you 
can:
    - Edit an html file, then type `\H` to save and preview the file. 
    - Visually select the full path of a local html file or a URL, then type `\h` 
      to preview the file or web page. 
    - Copy the full path of a local html file or a URL in another application, then 
      type `\h` to preview the file or web page in Vim. 


FROM 256 OPENING CURRENT VIM FILE IN YOUR WINDOWS BROWSER [HTTPS://VIM.FANDOM.COM/WIKI/OPENING_CURRENT_VIM_FILE_IN_YOUR_WINDOWS_BROWSER] *vtw-127-from-256-opening-current-vim-file-in-your-windows-browser-[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/opening_current_vim_file_in_your_windows_browser]*
    - TODO: Finish cleaning following notes. 


On Windows, using <cWORD> to open the link at the cursor in a browser does 
not work when the URL is in an html tag surrounded by quotes. However, using 
<cfile> works for both situations: plain URL and URL between html tags.

>
    " On Windows, open URL under cursor.
    nnoremap <F8> :!start C:\progra~1\intern~1\iexplore.exe <cfile><CR>
    nnoremap <F8> :!start C:\progra~1\mozill~1\firefox.exe <cfile><CR>
    " On Windows, open current file in Internet Explorer.
    nnoremap <F5> :update<Bar>silent !start c:\progra~1\intern~1\iexplore.exe file://%:p<CR>
    " On Linux, open URL under cursor in Firefox.
    nnoremap <F8> :silent !firefox <cfile><CR>
<

In the above, there is no space after `!` and the Vim command has the form 
`:!start program file` which causes Vim (on Windows) to run the specified 
program with the file as an argument. If the program is not in a PATH 
directory, the full path to the program must be specified. If the program path 
contains spaces, it is necessary to put the path in quotes (`"..."`).

==============================================================================

If using <cfile> or <cWORD> does not suit a particular requirement, it is 
possible to use a pattern to select what is needed. For example, the following 
takes the first match on the current line which starts with 'http' and 
continues with non-whitespace characters (it finishes at the first space or 
tab, or at the end of the line):

>
    nnoremap <F8> :execute 'silent ! start '.matchstr(getline('.'), 'http\S*')<CR>
<

==============================================================================

On Windows 7 this opens the current file in Chrome (fix the path by replacing 
"MyName" with what it should be on your system).

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F5> :update<Bar>silent !start "C:\Users\MyName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "file://%:p"<CR>
<

Or it might be here:

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F5> :update<Bar>silent !start "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "file://%:p"<CR>
<

==============================================================================

On Linux, use `xdg-open` to open the file using its default application. The 
first of the following mappings saves the current file, then opens it; the 
second opens the file under the cursor:

>
    nnoremap <F5> :update<Bar>silent !xdg-open %:p &<CR>
    nnoremap <F8> :silent !xdg-open <cfile> &<CR>
<

FROM 587 PREVIEW CURRENT FILE IN MOZILLA THROUGH LOCALHOST [HTTPS://VIM.FANDOM.COM/WIKI/PREVIEW_CURRENT_FILE_IN_MOZILLA_THROUGH_LOCALHOST] *vtw-127-from-587-preview-current-file-in-mozilla-through-localhost-[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/preview_current_file_in_mozilla_through_localhost]*

When editing an HTML file on Windows, enter the following to save the current 
file and open it in your default browser:

>
    :update|silent ! start %:p
<

On Windows, the current file can be opened in its associated application 
using the `start` command of the `cmd.exe` shell. With this mapping, press F5 
to save the current file and open it in its associated application:

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F5> :update<Bar>silent ! start %:p<CR>
<

The space after `!` is required (on Windows, a command of the form `!start 
xxx` causes Vim to run `xxx` asynchronously; Vim does not run `start`, whereas 
`! start xxx` invokes the shell `cmd.exe` to run its `start` internal command 
operating on `xxx`). In the unlikely case that the associated application runs 
in a console (command prompt window), it would be better to add the `/b` 
option so the application runs in the same console as `start`. That is, change 
the command to `start /b %:p`.

It is convenient to leave the browser window open: switch back to Vim to do 
any further editing required, save the file, then switch to the browser and 
tell it to reload the file with a key like Ctrl-R or F5.

A Linux version of the above mapping would use a program like `xdg-open`:

>
    nnoremap <F5> :update<Bar>silent !xdg-open %:p &<CR>
    nnoremap <F5> :silent update<Bar>silent !xdg-open %:p &<CR>

FROM 684 PREVIEW CURRENT HTML IN BROWSER ON MAC OS X [HTTPS://VIM.FANDOM.COM/WIKI/PREVIEW_CURRENT_HTML_IN_BROWSER_ON_MAC_OS_X] *vtw-127-from-684-preview-current-html-in-browser-on-mac-os-x-[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/preview_current_html_in_browser_on_mac_os_x]*
    - TODO: Clean following. 


There are a few tips on previewing current HTML documents in a Windows 
browser, but none I could find for Mac OS X. By studying the others, though, I 
stumbled on a mapping that works. The <CR> at the end anticipates the "Hit 
ENTER or type command to continue" message.

>
    nnoremap <F5> :!open -a Safari %<CR><CR>

Comments

To expand on this:

general -- "open x" will open "x" with the default application ... "open -a 
applicationName x" will open "x" with application "applicationName"

general -- "<D-aKey>" creates a shortcut using the Command (Apple) key

improved(?) -- "nnoremap <silent> <D-p>f :exe ':silent !open -a 
/Applications/Path/To/Firefox.app %'<CR>"

(prevents remapping, runs quietly, shortcut is now [Command+p,f] for 
"preview, firefox" ... helpful if you preview in multiple browsers)

improved(?) -- "nnoremap <silent> <D-p>p :exe ':silent !open %'<CR>"

(same, but creates a generic "preview" using default applications ... helpful 
if you only preview in that browser, or can use it on other file types)

other (open directory in Finder) -- "nnoremap <silent> <D-p>d :exe ':silent 
!open -a finder %:p:h'<CR>"

(%:p:h completely expands the file path and removes the file name so only 
directory is left)

other (apply same to netrw browser, ie, :Ex command) -- add to 
.vimrc/.gvimrc: "let g:netrw_browsex_viewer = 'open'" (this is not necessary 
starting with 7.2, netrw now uses "open" as the default for "x").

(when using netrw browser, hit "x" while cursor is on file name to open that 
file with the default application ... if the cursor is over a directory, it 
will open in Finder)

Also, for Mac users, here is a way to save the current PHP file then preview 
it through localhost (TODO see `%:p:s?pat?sub?` below for Vim procedure):

>
    nnoremap <F5> :update<Bar>!open -a Google\ Chrome `echo http://localhost/${PWD\#*/*/*/*/*/}/%`<CR>

FROM 1015 PREVIEW FILE ON LOCALHOST [HTTPS://VIM.FANDOM.COM/WIKI/PREVIEW_FILE_ON_LOCALHOST] *vtw-127-from-1015-preview-file-on-localhost-[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/preview_file_on_localhost]*

Using this mapping will save the current file (if changed), then preview it 
on localhost. For example, if you are editing file 
`/var/www/html/one/two/my.html`, pressing F5 will use Firefox to open 
`http://localhost/one/two/my.html`.

>
    nnoremap <F5> :silent update<Bar>silent !firefox %:p:s?\(.\{-}/\)\{4}?http://localhost/?<CR>
<

The core command has the form `!firefox %:p:s?pat?sub?` which uses the shell 
to start Firefox to open the current file (`%`) with its name modified by 
forming the full path (`:p`) then substituting the pattern `pat` with `sub`.

The pattern is `\(.\{-}/\)\{4}` which finds exactly four occurrences of any 
character (`.`) repeated as few times as possible (`\{-}`) up to and including 
the next slash (`/`). If the file being edited is `my.html` in directory 
`/var/www/html/one/two`, the pattern matches `/var/www/html/` (the first 
occurrence of four slashes, with any characters between).

FROM 201110 PREVIEW CURRENT HTML IN BROWSER ON LINUX [HTTPS://VIM.FANDOM.COM/WIKI/PREVIEW_CURRENT_HTML_IN_BROWSER_ON_LINUX] *vtw-127-from-201110-preview-current-html-in-browser-on-linux-[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/preview_current_html_in_browser_on_linux]*

This mapping allows you to use a browser to preview the HTML file currently 
being edited.

>
    nnoremap <F5> :silent update<Bar>silent !firefox %:p &<CR>
<

If necessary, the current file is saved, then Firefox is used to open the 
file. Replace "firefox" with the name of another browser if wanted, such as 
"chromium-browser".

I have removed the "Related plugins" section as the only plugin listed is 
obsolete and relies on Perl to do what can be done in plain Vim. JohnBeckett

I am working on merging a lot of tips related to opening HTML files in 
browsers, and documents in associated applications. I don't think anything 
more will be merged in to here. I will soon clean all this up and see how 
large the result is (some of it might then be moved elsewhere). JohnBeckett

In mappings, I am using F5 to open the current file and F8 to open the file 
under the cursor. Might rethink that after all merging complete. JohnBeckett

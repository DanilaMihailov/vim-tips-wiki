==============================================================================

Many tips that you find on this site and others will tell you to add some 
code to your .vimrc file. (Or on Windows, your _vimrc file.) :help 
|vimrc-intro|

Once you do this a few times, it can get pretty big and confusing, especially 
if the bits of configuration you are adding are each specific to a single 
language. Worse, some settings might be incompatible with others.

Happily, Vim has a very nice built-in way to organize and manage 
language-specific options by breaking them out into files and directories. You 
can learn all about it by reading :help |vimfiles|, :help |ftplugin-overrule|, 
:help |after-directory|.

The quick way to get started is to move all the language-specific stuff from 
your .vimrc file into a file named .vim/ftplugin/language.vim (or 
$HOME/vimfiles/ftplugin/language.vim on Windows).

This turns a .vimrc that looks like this:

>
    autocmd FileType * set tabstop=2|set shiftwidth=2|set noexpandtab
    autocmd FileType python set tabstop=4|set shiftwidth=4|set expandtab
    au BufEnter *.py set ai sw=4 ts=4 sta et fo=croql
<

Into this:

>
    " File ~/.vimrc
    " ($HOME/_vimrc on Windows)
    " Global settings for all files (but may be overridden in ftplugin).
    set tabstop=2
    set shiftwidth=2
    set noexpandtab
    
    " File ~/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim
    " ($HOME/vimfiles/ftplugin/python.vim on Windows)
    " Python specific settings.
    setlocal tabstop=4
    setlocal shiftwidth=4
    setlocal expandtab
    setlocal autoindent
    setlocal smarttab
    setlocal formatoptions=croql
<

If there is a filetype plugin distributed with Vim that you want to 
completely disable, make your own (perhaps empty) settings file and adding 
this line:

>
    let b:did_ftplugin = 1
<

If you like most of what Vim's filetype plugin is doing, but you want to 
override something specific, you can place your settings in 
.vim/after/ftplugin/language.vim ($HOME/vimfiles/after/ftplugin/language.vim 
on Windows). See :help |after-directory|

If there is a new file extension that you want Vim to recognize, don't muck 
about with augroup in your .vimrc, put the settings in the right place. See 
:help |ftdetect|

There is a lot more you can do with your ~/.vim directory ($HOME/vimfiles on 
Windows). ~/.vim/compiler is a good place to keep configuration that gets 
applied on a per-compiler basis (for example, I might need to use any of 
javac, jikes, ant, or make to compile and parse the compiler output for a java 
source file.) I also like to keep a couple color schemes in ~/.vim/colors, and 
I keep notes in vimhelp format in ~/.vim/doc. Periodically running :helptags 
~/.vim/doc lets me jump to a tag in those notes using :h. :help |helptags| 
:help |vimfiles|

This tip suggests moving language-specific settings to a suitable ftplugin 
file. For that to work, you need to have file type detection enabled. Enter 
the command :filetype to determine whether detection is enabled on your 
system. On some Linux distributions, file type detection is disabled, in which 
case you should add a command like the following to your vimrc:

>
    filetype plugin on
    " Alternative: use the following to also enable language-dependent indenting.
    filetype plugin indent on
<

A minor point: It's "recommended" to keep 'tabstop' at 8 when using 
'expandtab', since that will ensure that the text or code looks the same way 
in dumb viewers and when printing. (Spiiph

However, the tabstop = 8 rule is nowhere near universal. For instance, in 
Java and Python, tabs are usually 4 spaces. Meviin

I don't know Java, but in Python, where indenting is important, the standards of the language mandate that hard tabs MUST be interpreted as equivalent to as many spaces would be needed to reach the next multiple of 8, not 4. This applies when not using 'expandtab', since when you use it you are inserting spaces anyway, as Fritzophrenic said. — Tonymec (talk) 04:38, February 13, 2013 (UTC)

Python is a perfect example of how no tabstop setting is universal. The official style guide (PEP8) currently defines one indentation level as 4 spaces with the caveat "For really old code that you don't want to mess up, you can continue to use 8-space tabs." --Pydave (talk) 23:19, March 3, 2013 (UTC)

With Python, this isn't just a matter of style, it's a matter of syntax. Python syntax explicitly interprets a tab as being 8-space aligned. As a matter of style, you can do what you like, but if tabs and spaces are mixed in a single Python file, that 8-space alignment is what Python will use when it interprets your script. See [1]. Me and (talk) 11:00, October 9, 2013 (UTC)

When using 'expandtab', it should always look the same in "dumb" viewers 
anyway, since you're inserting spaces instead of tabs. --Fritzophrenic 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Fritzophrenic] 16:22, June 27, 2012 (UTC)

I agree with --Fritzophrenic 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Fritzophrenic]. I do that for years. The 
best way to configure is setting 'expandtab' to '1' and setting 'tabstop' to 
something you like. I always replaced tabs with spaces. Even before I started 
to use Vim (many years ago). 01:17, November 21, 2012 (UTC)

Thanks for the advice on "filetype plugin on". Vim wasn't picking up my 
ftplugin configs and it was driving me nuts.

==============================================================================

Tabs vs. spaces for whitespace: which to use? Tabs are good for indentation 
because their width can be adjusted according to preference (:help 'tabstop'). 
On the other hand, spaces must be used to ensure text stays lined up across 
lines if `tabstop` is changed.

Using the "smart tabs |vtw-1626-smart-tabs|" scheme described below combines 
the strengths of both.

This tip discusses indenting using tabs and spaces, including methods to 
allow `tabstop` adjustment, while maintaining textual alignment. See indenting 
source code |vtw-83| for background information on indenting.

SPACES OR TABS?                                     *vtw-1626-spaces-or-tabs?*

Programs use whitespace (spaces or tabs) for two purposes:
    - To indent blocks of code (for example, to show the code that is in a loop). 
    - To align text (for example, so comments start in the same column). 


Some procedures commonly used to write programs are:
    - Use spaces for indentation and alignment. 
    - Use tabs |vtw-1626-using-tabs-for-indentation| for indentation and alignment. 
    - Use a mixture of tabs and spaces for indentation and alignment. 
    - Use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment ("smart tabs 
      |vtw-1626-smart-tabs|"). 


In large projects, using as many tabs as possible can significantly reduce 
the size of the source code, and in some rare cases (for example, make files 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/make_(software)]), tabs must be used for 
indentation. Apart from these considerations, whether you use tabs or spaces 
is generally a personal choice, or is determined by the coding style of the 
project.

Using spaces for indentation means that the code will look the same on all 
systems, even if the `tabstop` option is changed. However, different people 
like different indent sizes, so a common procedure is to use tabs for 
indentation so the indent size can easily be adjusted to suit whoever is 
working on the code. If the `tabstop` size is changed, it is necessary to use 
spaces for alignment because that will maintain the alignment with a different 
`tabstop`, provided the lines with aligned text use the same number of tabs 
for indenting.

Here is an example using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment:

>
    int sample(int a)
    {
    |-------int   count;      // variable names are aligned
    |-------float average;    // (some people like it that way)
    |-------if (a > 0)
    |-------|-------return 1;
    |-------return 0;
    }
<

In the above, "`|-------`" represents a tab using the default `:set 
tabstop=8`. Entering `:set tabstop=4` makes the code appear as:

>
    int sample(int a)
    {
    |---int   count;      // variable names are aligned
    |---float average;    // (some people like it this way)
    |---if (a > 0)
    |---|---return 1;
    |---return 0;
    }
<

This illustrates that using tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment 
keeps the alignment unchanged when the `tabstop` is altered (for lines with 
the same indent).

USING TABS FOR INDENTATION               *vtw-1626-using-tabs-for-indentation*

If you want to use only tabs for indentation (not spaces), enter the 
following command (replace `4` with your preferred column width for each 
indent level):

>
    :set noet ci pi sts=0 sw=4 ts=4
<

The previous line is an abbreviated equivalent of these commands:

>
    :set noexpandtab
    :set copyindent
    :set preserveindent
    :set softtabstop=0
    :set shiftwidth=4
    :set tabstop=4
<

However, note that in the case of continuation lines 
|vtw-1626-continuation-lines|, some spaces may be added when the indentation 
is not a multiple of `tabstop`.

If you want the commands to affect only the current buffer, replace `set` 
with `setlocal` (abbreviated as `setl`). More information is here |vtw-83|.

SMART TABS                                               *vtw-1626-smart-tabs*

The settings above use hard tabs as far as possible. To use tabs in a more 
"semantic" way – i.e., the number of tabs equals the indentation level – 
install the Smart Tabs [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=231] 
plugin.

The plugin ensures that tabs are only used for indentation, while spaces are 
used everywhere else. When you press Tab in insert mode, a tab is inserted 
when indenting, and/or the correct number of spaces when aligning text (see 
continuation lines |vtw-1626-continuation-lines|). Different people can then 
use whatever `shiftwidth` and `tabstop` they want (provided these two values 
are equal) – the end result is the same, and is displayed correctly 
everywhere.

You do not need a "smart" editor to display or edit smartly tabbed files – 
that's the whole point. The Smart Tabs plugin is just an added convenience. If 
your non-Vim-using collaborators remain unconvinced, pass them these pointers, 
whichever is appropriate: smart tabs for Emacs 
[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs], and IntelliJ IDEA 
[http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/] has a built-in "smart tabs" option.

CONTINUATION LINES                               *vtw-1626-continuation-lines*

When expressions span multiple lines, you may want to line up the beginning 
of those lines with the beginning of the expression in the first line:

>
    int f(int x,
          int y) {
        return g(x,
                 y);
    }
<

To make Vim format the code in this way, using four-column indentation, enter 
the following (use `setl` instead of `set` to affect only the current buffer):

>
    :set noet sts=0 sw=4 ts=4
    :set cindent
    :set cinoptions=(0,u0,U0
<

Using the Smart Tabs plugin, tabs will then only be used for indenting (in 
the third and fourth lines), while spaces will be used for alignment:

>
    int f(int x,
          int y) {
    |---return g(x,
    |---         y);
    }
<

That makes the alignment of "`x`" and "`y`" independent of `tabstop`.

This edit 
[https://vim.fandom.com/index.php?title=Indent_with_tabs,_align_with_spaces&diff=26650&oldid=26649] 
added copyindent and preserveindent to the #Using tabs for indentation 
|vtw-1626-using-tabs-for-indentation| section. I do not understand the benefit 
of these in that section which asserts that only tabs will be used for 
indentation. These options should be mentioned somewhere (here or in Indenting 
source code [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code]), but possibly 
not in that section. Any thoughts? JohnBeckett

Those options are useful for preserving manually created indentation, which is useful for using tabs for the indent (automatic) and then manually adding spaces to align stuff. --Fritzophrenic (talk) 16:18, March 4, 2015 (UTC)

==============================================================================

Hi, do I need the Smart Tabs plugin to get the behaviour like 
"Indent_with_tabs,_align_with_spaces"? Because first you say`:set noet ci pi 
sts=0 sw=4 ts=4`to use only tabs for indentation (not spaces), which 
implicitly means spaces for aligning, no?Later you say I need the Smart Tabs 
plugin because. Massimo.b [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Massimo.b] 2015-03-04



Without Smart Tabs, Vim can insert tabs for indentation for you, but you will need to manually add spaces to do alignment past the indentation. The copyindent/preserveindent settings let Vim automatically copy that manual alignment for the next line, but the space-based alignment is still a manual step. And pressing Tab will always insert a tab with this setup, it will never insert any spaces, so it will take more keypresses to insert large amounts of alignment whitespace. With Smart Tabs, if I understand correctly what the plugin does, the plugin will automatically figure out whether you are adding indentation or alignment whitespace, and insert a space or tab accordingly. --Fritzophrenic (talk) 16:18, March 4, 2015 (UTC)

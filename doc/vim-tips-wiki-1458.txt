==============================================================================

To accelerate your motion when moving the cursor, use:

>
    :noremap <M-l> 4l
    :noremap <M-h> 4h
<

and maybe

>
    :noremap <M-j> 4j
    :noremap <M-k> 4k
<

Now when you are moving around your text, press Alt to get the cursor 
accelerated.

One might wonder why these mappings would be useful, since there are so many 
other ways to move quickly. These mappings have some advantages, however. For 
example, if you use 'w' or 'b' to move, the cursor jumps unevenly, so you 
must:
    - Press it somewhat slowly as your eye tracks where the cursor moves with each 
      press; or 
    - Count (or estimate) the number of words to jump, press the key sequence, then 
      correct any mistake you made. 


Another option is to use 'f<char>' (followed by ';'), but this is a similar 
case:
    - Find a character close to where you want to go (e.g. h), press 'fh', and keep 
      pressing ';' until you get close by. 


All three options require the eye to actively track the cursor and/or the 
mind to count words. However, if you just hold down 'l' (or in this tip's 
case, 'Alt_l'), you needn't think about it. The cursor moves at a steady pace, 
so the eye (and mind) can estimate the destination based on timing. This is 
not possible using 'w', since it does NOT move steadily.

When you want to move closer to the middle of a line, you have the built-in 
normal mode command |gm|

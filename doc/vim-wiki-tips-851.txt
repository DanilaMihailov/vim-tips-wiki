There is finally an extension for Thunderbird that enables you to compose 
mail in an external editor.

You can find it at http://globs.org/?lng=en [http://globs.org/?lng=en]

It works also in Windows 2000, as well as Windows XP and Linux as the author 
claims. I couldn't make it work at first. You have to start a new message, 
right click the toolbar and add an icon for External Editor. Now, when you 
click on the icon, your mail is displayed in Vim.

> Frankly, I think this tip should be removed. The plugin was last updated 
2005 and it is not compatible with recent versions of Thunderbird anymore.

> Why not use a real mail client (pine, mutt) instead?

Because here at work I am stuck in Windows. I have tried using pine, mutt in 
Windows, even Sylpheed. They do not work as I expect.

At home I am using FreeBSD, and I am using Thunderbird as a mail client for 
our "family" address so my wife can use it too. The beauty is, she gets the 
default interface, and I can press Vim icon and get my preferred editor.

> Why not use a real mail client (pine, mutt) instead?

Obviously you have never tried managing multiple IMAP accounts with mutt.

==============================================================================

The author has now fixed the bugs so that carriage returns are not shown in 
Windows and you can use "+set ft=mail" as an argument.

So my value for text editor is now

>
    gvim.exe "+set ft=mail"
<

and it works very nicely.

If gvim is not in your path, you'll have to fully qualify it.

The docs say to use:

>
    gvim --nofork
<

==============================================================================

That extension does not support multibyte language. When writing mail in 
English, it works well.

I copy the content from Thunderbird to Vim, and then `:set syntax=mail`, then 
edit it, then paste it back to Thunderbird.

==============================================================================

Use vim in a terminal is also possible for thunderbird's external editor. A 
small script can be downloaded from Fclose.com 
[http://www.fclose.com/b/linux/3301/vim-as-thunderbirds-external-editor-in-linux/]. 
This provides a familiar way for many Linux users.

There is finally an extension for Thunderbird that enables you to compose 
mail in an external editor.

You can find it at http://globs.org/?lng=en [http://globs.org/?lng=en]

It works also in Windows 2000, as well as Windows XP and Linux as the author 
claims. I couldn't make it work at first. You have to start a new message, 
right click the toolbar and add an icon for External Editor. Now, when you 
click on the icon, your mail is displayed in Vim.

2005 and it is not compatible with recent versions of Thunderbird anymore.

Because here at work I am stuck in Windows. I have tried using pine, mutt in 
Windows, even Sylpheed. They do not work as I expect.

At home I am using FreeBSD, and I am using Thunderbird as a mail client for 
our "family" address so my wife can use it too. The beauty is, she gets the 
default interface, and I can press Vim icon and get my preferred editor.

Obviously you have never tried managing multiple IMAP accounts with mutt.

==============================================================================

The author has now fixed the bugs so that carriage returns are not shown in 
Windows and you can use "+set ft=mail" as an argument.

So my value for text editor is now

>
    gvim.exe "+set ft=mail"
<

and it works very nicely.

If gvim is not in your path, you'll have to fully qualify it.

The docs say to use:

>
    gvim --nofork
<

==============================================================================

That extension does not support multibyte language. When writing mail in 
English, it works well.

I copy the content from Thunderbird to Vim, and then :set syntax=mail, then 
edit it, then paste it back to Thunderbird.

Use vim in a terminal is also possible for thunderbird's external editor. A 
small script can be downloaded from Fclose.com 
[http://www.fclose.com/b/linux/3301/vim-as-thunderbirds-external-editor-in-linux/]. 
This provides a familiar way for many Linux users.

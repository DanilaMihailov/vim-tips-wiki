==============================================================================

To format the current paragraph:
    - `gqap` 
    - `gwap` same, but restores cursor position

TO DO
    - Thanks to anon who pointed out that gwap makes the original tip obsolete (I 
      have removed it). 
    - We don't have any other tips that explain basics of paragraph formatting, so 
      this may as well be it. 
    - Need to explain what "format" means here. 
    - Need to mention textwidth, formatexpr, formatprg and probably more (but keep 
      it simple).

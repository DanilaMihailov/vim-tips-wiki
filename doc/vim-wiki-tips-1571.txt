==============================================================================

When reading text files, it can be convenient to switch to a pager-like 
scroll behavior (as with the less utility), where j and k scroll the document 
by one line, while keeping the cursor on the same buffer line. Of course you 
can scroll with Ctrl-e and Ctrl-y, but they require the control key.

With the following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], you can 
press F5 to toggle scrolling on or off. When on, press j or k to scroll by one 
line, or d or u to scroll by half a page.

>
    function! LessMode()
      if g:lessmode == 0
        let g:lessmode = 1
        let onoff = 'on'
        " Scroll half a page down
        noremap <script> d <C-D>
        " Scroll one line down
        noremap <script> j <C-E>
        " Scroll half a page up
        noremap <script> u <C-U>
        " Scroll one line up
        noremap <script> k <C-Y>
      else
        let g:lessmode = 0
        let onoff = 'off'
        unmap d
        unmap j
        unmap u
        unmap k
      endif
      echohl Label | echo "Less mode" onoff | echohl None
    endfunction
    let g:lessmode = 0
    nnoremap <F5> :call LessMode()<CR>
    inoremap <F5> <Esc>:call LessMode()<CR>

Plugins like LessMode are available, but they may be more complex than you 
require.

If you prefer modeless solutions, check out
    - 105 Combining move and scroll |vwt-105| (which maps c-j> and <c-k> to scroll 
      one line up and down keeping the cursor in the same position on screen) 
    - 400 Fast scroll mappings |vwt-400| (does the same as VimTip105 |vwt-105| but 
      maps the keys to <Alt-h/j/k/l/>, also mappings for insert and visual mode. 
      Mappings might clash with GUI Shortcuts, e.g. <A-h> opens help menu) 
    - 239 Scroll using arrow keys like in a web browser |vwt-239| (map <Shift-up> 
      and <Shift-Down> to <c-e> and <c-y>. This might not work on all terminals, 
      though it does in xterm, konsole and rxvt-unicode on Linux) 


There's also a tip (320 Page up/down and keep cursor position |vwt-320|) to 
make vim behave like Borland IDE when using PageUp/PageDown, so that the 
cursor stays on the same column.

Besides, if you don't like scrolling manually, make vim do it automatically 
for you as described in 1198 Automatic scrolling of text |vwt-1198|.

In conclusion: If you prefer the modal approach, then go with the LessMode() 
function, it's fast and doesn't require key combinations. If you prefer to 
stay in the mode you're in, use VimTip400 |vwt-400|, it should work on most 
GUIs and Terminals and does not require scroll/cusor movement combinations 
which might not work as expected in some cases (start of line, end of line, 
start of document etc.).

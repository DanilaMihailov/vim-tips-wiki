==============================================================================

I am using Windows 2000, US system. I have a bunch of text files coming from 
a DOS machine (OEM charset), with characters above code 127. I would like to 
convert those files into ANSI charset, so that I can see those characters 
appropriately everywhere under Windows.

Open the file in Vim and enter these commands:

>
    :set encoding=cp437
    :set fileencoding=latin1
    :wq
<

You can now reopen the file and the characters should have been converted. I 
prefer to quit after the conversion so that encoding and fileencoding are 
reset, but I supopse you can simply set encoding back to latin1.

cp437 is the code page for the OEM charset.

Did the same to transform UNICODE (UTF-8) to Latim-1 (ISO-8859-1) and it 
worked.

I recommend to anyone having trouble understanding these encodings to read 
the following article:

This tip is deprecated for the following reasons:

As suggested in the comments, this functionality is built-in to Vim, with the 
:diffthis, :diffsplit, :diffoff, etc. commands

If you are already in Vim, there are two methods to do a vimdiff:
    - Run another Vim with command line vimdiff.
    - Open a new window (C-w s) and then enter appropriate commands in the two buffers.


This tip provides a function (SetDiffEnviron) to set the "diff" environment 
in buffer. So, if you want to diff the right and the left window, you have to 
run :SetDiffEnviron into the right and the left buffer.

Add the following to your vimrc file:

>
    function! SetDiffEnviron()
      set diff
      set scrollbind
      set scrollopt=ver,jump,hor
      set nowrap
      set fdm=diff
    endfunction
    :command! SetDiffEnviron call SetDiffEnviron()

COMMENTS  *vwt-1343-comments*

How does this differ from the :diffthis command?

==============================================================================

Might I suggest the following commands instead:

>
    :sp <filename>
    :windo diffthis
<

For variety, you could try :vs instead of :sp

==============================================================================

I think the easiest way to diff a currently open file with another is the 
:diffsplit command. It loads the file and sets all the right options. 
Personally I like to use :vert diffsplit

==============================================================================

Getting into 'diff' mode is quite easy, as other comments have shown. Turning 
off 'diff' mode (without quitting Vim or deleting the buffers) is more 
complex. I use the following function:

>
    " Switch off diff-mode of all currently open windows.
    command! DiffOff call DiffOff()
    function! DiffOff()
      windo set nodiff
      windo set noscrollbind
      " Reset, then restore the 'foldmethod' and 'foldcolumn' settings by
      " re-setting the filetype. This triggers the filetype-based folding to be
      " reactivated, and ( contrary to a simple :e!) works even on modified
      " buffers.
      windo set foldmethod=manual
      windo set foldcolumn=0
      windo unlet! b:did_ftplugin | let &filetype = &filetype
    endfunction
<

==============================================================================

As of Vim 7, there is also :diffoff which is very similar to the DiffOff 
function above.

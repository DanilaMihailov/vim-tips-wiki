==============================================================================

We are forever using copy and paste to copy information from application to 
application. Inevitably however we need to edit/reformat the buffer contents. 
This tip allows you to quickly open a separate Vim containing just the paste 
contents. You may then edit these contents as required, writing or closing Vim 
automatically causes the changed contents to be rewritten to the paste buffer.

The following is a CygWin script (could just as easily be a Win32 batch 
file).

>
    function vxp
    {
      # description : Edit paste contents
      gvim -c 'normal ggdG"*p' c:/aaa/xp
    }
<

Such that I just type vxp and it opens a new Vim just containing the current 
paste buffer.

To automatically cause the rewriting of the paste buffer add the following to 
your vimrc

>
    autocmd bufWritePost c:/aaa/xp normal ggVG"*y
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-623-comments*

Similarly to autocmd bufWritePost you can also get Vim to automatically 
perform commands on entering or leaving a file(s)

>
    BufEnter After entering a buffer. Useful for setting
     options for a file type. Also executed when
     starting to edit a buffer, after the
     BufReadPost autocommands.
    
    BufLeave Before leaving to another buffer. Also when
     leaving or closing the current window and the
     new current window is not for the same buffer.
     Not used for ":qa" or ":q" when exiting Vim.

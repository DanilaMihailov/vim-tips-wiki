==============================================================================

On Unix-based systems, the Meta (Alt) key may not work in Vim. For example, 
in insert mode, pressing Meta-A (Alt-A) may exit to normal mode, then execute 
normal-mode commands. This can occur with non-GUI Vim under some terminal 
emulators – those which generate escape sequences for Meta-characters. The 
actually generated escape-sequences are <Esc>a .. <Esc>z.

SOLUTION                                                    *vtw-738-solution*

You must manually configure Vim to recognize these escape-sequences as 
Meta-characters, see below. Terminal emulators which are known to generate 
these sequences for Meta-keys are: rxvt (unix), putty (PC), teraterm (PC). Vim 
expects characters 225-250 for Meta-keys.

Here's how to fix Meta-keys on the Vim side:

Check what your Meta-keys generate:

>
    i<press Ctrl-V><press Meta-A>
<

If you see `^[a` (that is, escape character followed by something), then add 
this snippet to your vimrc:

>
    " fix meta-keys which generate <Esc>a .. <Esc>z
    let c='a'
    while c <= 'z'
      exec "set <M-".toupper(c).">=\e".c
      exec "imap \e".c." <M-".toupper(c).">"
      let c = nr2char(1+char2nr(c))
    endw
<

To fix Meta-keys definitions manually key-by-key:

>
    :set <M-A>=<press Ctrl-V><press Meta-A>
    :imap <press ctrl-v><press Esc>a <M-A>
    ; repeat each Meta-key.
<

Don't attempt to map <M-[> or <M-Leader> in this situation. The former will 
break mouse support (and possibly other things), and the latter doesn't play 
nicely when exiting insert mode and attempting to perform a leader-bound 
command.

COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-738-comments*

Suggested fix does not work in PuTTY on Windows XP, using Vim 6.1.5.

The Vim help files suggest, for example:

>
    :set <M-b>=^[b
<

This works, but remember to set ttimeoutlen to something small!

Also note, Meta-key mappings are case-sensitive (e.g. <m-b> and <m-B> are 
different).

In rxvt I found that the :set <M-a>=^]a commands don't work, instead only the 
map commands are needed. So I used:

>
    for i in range(65,90) + range(97,122)
      let c = nr2char(i)
      exec "map \e".c." <M-".c.">"
      exec "map! \e".c." <M-".c.">"
    endfor
<

instead of the snippet given above, and everything works fine now.

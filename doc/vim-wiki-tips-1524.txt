TIP 1524 HAS BEEN REMOVED  *vwt-1524-tip-1524-has-been-removed*

It is hard to find helpful information if there are too many tips.

Therefore, we are removing some tips that refer to obsolete versions, or 
which have been superseded, or which are no longer useful.

This tip was created on this wiki (it was not imported from vim.org).

Tip was an unsuccessful experiment. Needs a customized formatexpr or 
formatprg, and no progress has been made in 8 months.

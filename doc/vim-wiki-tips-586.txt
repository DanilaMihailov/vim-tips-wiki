==============================================================================

Using :put " pastes text from the default register below the current line. 
That is useful if some characters within a line have been copied, and you 
would like the copied text pasted as a separate line.

Use the following mappings in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] 
to make that easier. The first pastes after the current line, while the second 
pastes before the current line.

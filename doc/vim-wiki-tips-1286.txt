==============================================================================

The diff mode of Vim and Gvim is really excellent, and I like to use it as 
the external diff application with TortoiseCVS. Here's how you would configure 
this:

1. Right-click any file and choose "CVS -> Preferences".

2. In the TortoiseCVS window, choose the "Tools" tab.

3. Place the following in the "Diff Application" text box (adjust for your 
Vim install location):

>
    C:\Program Files\Vim\vim70\gvim.exe
<

4. Place the following in the "Two-way diff parameters" text box:

>
    -d "%1" "%2"
<

Now you should be able to right-click a CVS-controlled file, choose the "CVS 
diff" option and view results in Gvim.

Any additional Gvim parameters should only appear in the "Two-way diff 
parameters" text box, not the "Diff application" text box.

==============================================================================

I was trying to figure out why Alt+space would not work, as I would have to 
use the mouse to maximize/restore/minimize my gvim window (on Win32) which was 
a pain and found that I needed to

>
    set winaltkeys=yes
<

to make this work. Now I can use

>
    Alt+Space followed by 'x to maximize
    Alt+Space followed by 'n' to minimize
    Alt+Space followed by 'r' to restore!
<

Note that with `winaltkeys=yes`, you won't be able to map any ALT key 
combinations. If this is a problem for you, try `winaltkeys=menu` or 
`winaltkeys=no` in conjunction with `:simalt`.

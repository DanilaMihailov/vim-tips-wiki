==============================================================================

This tip shows techniques to compile or to run make for the file in the 
current buffer. This is useful to list any compile errors in the quickfix 
window.

COMPILE WITH GCC  *vwt-264-compile-with-gcc*

If you use

>
    set makeprg=gcc\ -o\ %<\ %
<

in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], and your actual file is 
file.c, then :make will compile file.c with the output file. (gcc file.c -o 
file).

If you use GNU make the above change is not required. Instead, simply use the 
following command to compile the current file (you need to save it first):

>
    :make %:r
<

When using other compilers, like Sun cc, you can adapt the tip to suit your 
compiler.

INVOKING MAKE  *vwt-264-invoking-make*

The following allows you to press F7 (in normal mode) to invoke make to 
compile the file in the current buffer. If modified, the file is first saved.

>
    " Save and make current file.o
    function! Make()
      let curr_dir = expand('%:h')
      if curr_dir == ''
        let curr_dir = '.'
      endif
      echo curr_dir
      execute 'lcd ' . curr_dir
      execute 'make %:r.o'
      execute 'lcd -'
    endfunction
    nnoremap <F7> :update<CR>:call Make()<CR>

TO DO
    - I've done a pretty quick clean up. Would someone please reply here with news about whether it actually works (after testing).
    - "set makeprg=gcc\ -o\ %<\ %" worked with VIM 8.0 on OSX 10.12.16

    - Need some explanation, including note about (deprecated) %<. JohnBeckett [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:JohnBeckett] 04:49, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

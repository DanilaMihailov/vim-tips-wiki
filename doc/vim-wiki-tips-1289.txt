==============================================================================

Sometimes, a single-line echo causes the "Press Enter" prompt even though the 
message is considerably shorter than screen width. This is often an 
inconvenience for script writers.

The WideMsg() function below prints a single-line [long] message (of up to 
(&columns-1) length) without the "Press Enter" prompt, guaranteed:

    " WideMsg() prints [long] message up to (&columns-1) length
    " guaranteed without "Press Enter" prompt.
    function! WideMsg(msg)
      let x=&ruler | let y=&showcmd
      set noruler noshowcmd
      redraw
      echo a:msg
      let &ruler=x | let &showcmd=y
    endfun
    
    " To test.
    :set ruler showcmd
    :call WideMsg(repeat('x',&co-1))
<

Explanation

There are two options, 'showcmd' and 'ruler', that force the "Press Enter" 
prompt after messages that are shorter than screen width. Either of two 
options, when set, take space on the right of the bottom line.

The WideMsg() function above saves values of these two suspect options, echo 
the message, then restores the options.

There is no "Press Enter" prompt, and options are properly restored.

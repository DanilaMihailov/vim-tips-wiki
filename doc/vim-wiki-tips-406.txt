==============================================================================

You don't need to use the slash character as the expression delimiter. 
Whatever character follows the `:s` is defined to be the delimiter character. 
You can use most non-alphanumeric characters (but not \, " or |). This is very 
handy when working with Unix filenames, as in the following example:

>
    :s#/usr/local/#/opt/#
<

If you insist on using the normal slash, you have to escape each slash in the 
pattern with a backslash:

>
    :s/\/usr\/local\//\/opt\//
<

As you can see, the escaping method is much less readable, so consider 
carefully your choice of delimiter character!

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-406-comments*

What a great tip. Very nice when trying to comment out Java or JS. e.g. :5,8 
s#^#//# which looks much nicer than :5,8 s/^/\/\//

The percent ('%') character is also a frequently used alternative.Both 
percent and the octothorpe ("pound sign") ('#') charactershave '/' embedded in 
them, to visually cue you why they are there as delimiters.

Other common choices are the hypen and underscore. (Protip: This tip can be 
applied in a lot of other places, especially when writing in a language (e.g. 
JavaScript, Perl).) SheeEttin [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:SheeEttin]

A comma delimiter works well and seems less cluttery. This is particularly 
handy for text, HTML/XML or Ruby.

Patches and whatnot are distributed on vim-dev, but typically don't contain 
the updates to files in the directories above. If you're having a problem with 
syntax highlighting, for instance, check the syntax repository above just in 
case its been fixed already.

In my own case, I put experimental versions of syntax highlighting files and 
plugins that I maintain here [http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/], such as 
netrw.vim (netrw v46a now supports remote directory listing for example).

If you have `rsync` installed, you can use it to synchronize your runtime 
files. I use it to keep my "master" runtimes up-to-date, currently at 
`~/.build/vim/vim72/runtime/`, as follows (the "parent" `vim72` directory 
being the current directory):

>
    rsync -avzcP --delete --exclude="/dos/" ftp.nluug.nl::Vim/runtime/ ./runtime/
<

On Linux, I follow that by a `make installruntime` step if anything other 
than `tags` has been updated.

Note: Even on Windows, where I expect rsync to be available at least via 
Cygwin and/or MinGW and/or GnuWin32, I recommend downloading the "Unix" 
runtimes; even Vim for Windows can source them with no problem. It's true that 
Notepad cannot display them correctly, but Wordpad can. — Tonymec

An alternative is to use an ftp mirroring tool (e.g. the fmirror tool 
ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/nir/ftp/utilities/fmirror/ 
[ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/nir/ftp/utilities/fmirror/] [link dead, fmirror seems 
to be abandoned now]). To use this script, change into the vimXX/runtime 
directory directory and run this:

>
    /usr/bin/fmirror -k \
     -l $HOME/src/vimXX/runtime \
     -p user@domain.com \
     -r /pub/vim/runtime \
     -s ftp.vim.org \
     -S -V3
<

After having updated the runtime files change into the vimXX/src directory(or 
whatever version we're at) and do a "make installruntime".

Note, replace the vimXX by whatever version of vim you are using (e.g. 73 for 
Vim version 7.3)

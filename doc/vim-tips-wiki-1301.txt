For Windows users that use Windows file associations 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Windows_file_associations] to automatically 
launch files in Vim 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Launch_files_in_new_tabs_under_Windows], a gem 
I've found is, in a command prompt window:

>
    assoc .=txtfile
<

Where txtfile has been defined as a file type that is opened with Vim. See 
VimTip1003 |vtw-1003|, and try `ftype /?` at the command prompt.

This will cause files with no extension (e.g. "Makefile") to open 
automatically in Vim.

You may need to logout and log back in before this will take effect.WARNING: Editing your Windows registry may cause unintended side effects that render your system inoperable. Although this tip has worked in the past for some people, there is no guarantee that it will work for you. Use with caution, and at your own risk.

You can also use the Windows Registry to set up the extensionless file 
association. For example, by importing the following registry file (adjust for 
correct Vim version):

>
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.]
    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.\shell]
    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.\shell\open]
    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.\shell\open\command]
    @="\"C:\\Vim\\vim61\\gvim.exe\" \"%1\""
<

      an extension but have no file association.

==============================================================================

This page is dodgy [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Dodgy]. The contents 
may not be useful for Vim 7. If you think this tip is useful, please edit it 
to make the problem and its solution more understandable, and remove the 
{{Dodgy}} tag.

as noted in the comments, simpler solutions such as *, #, gD, gd, or the 
TagList plugin exist for jumping around within a single file

Ctags allows you to search for a tag associated with an identifier.

This script allows to search for an identifier in the current open file 
without using an identifier, that is displays the "tags" file for current 
opened file.

Shell script:

>
    cat /usr/local/bin/vimlocal.sh
    echo | /usr/bin/ctags --extra=+fq --if0=yes --file-scope=yes --fields=+afmikKlnsz --c-types=+cdefgmnpstuvx --c++-types=+cdefgmnpstuvx -x -n --filter "$@" | tr -s '[ \t]' '@' |sed -e "s,^\([_-~:A-Za-z]\+\)@\([_-~:A-Za-z]\+\)@\([0-9]\+\).*, \3 \1," | sed -e "s,[_-~A-Za-z]\+::,,"|sort -k1 -n |uniq
<

Vim mapping:

>
    map <M-l> <Esc>:!/usr/local/bin/vimlocals.sh % <CR>:
<

Note:

1. ctags options probably don't have to be so many.

2. There are more complex alternatives like excellent taglist.vim which will 
open and IDE type environment but I prefer simple solutions based on unix 
command-lines.

COMMENTS  *vwt-711-comments*

Huh? To search in this file for an identifer in this file, why not just hit * 
while the cursor is on the identifier?

==============================================================================

I haven't tried the tip, but I'm assuming it's so you can jump to the 
function declaration, rather than match for every occurrence of the keyword.

==============================================================================

"F4" (see help) and/or search helps for identifier under cursors. This is not 
a substitute for "tags" file, it just helps to look for indentifier (function 
or variable ) which is not under the cursor and jump between them which is 
helpfull when you work with large files.

==============================================================================

These two mappings make it quick and easy to insert a word.

>
    nmap <buffer> <silent> ,w :exec ":imap \<space\> \<space\>\<esc\>,BB"<CR>i
    nmap <buffer> <silent> ,BB :exec ":iunmap \<space\>"<CR>
<

Given the sentence:

>
    The quick fox.
<

To add the word "brown" you would put your cursor on the f in fox and type 
",w" (or whatever you decide is a good mapping). Type the word brown. As soon 
as you hit space you are out of insert mode.

COMMENTS  *vwt-348-comments*

Unless I missed something, this doesn't save any keystrokes. Without this, I 
would use two keystrokes "i" to enter insert mode and ESC to exit. Here I 
still would still need two keystokes "," and "w".

==============================================================================

Size isn't everything! This seems easier. Finding the ESC is harder than , . 
and with this you'reentering ,w together rather than a key before your word 
and another key at the end. So you start this with 2 characters, but it ends 
itself automatically, which seems easier and more fluid to me.

==============================================================================

I get a lot of mileage out of cw which is change word and dw which is delete 
word.

Try them out!

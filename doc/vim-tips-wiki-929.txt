==============================================================================

We still use InstallShield MP 5.x and I find the lack of search functionality 
in the GUI very hindering (I don't if this is still the case with the newer 
10.x and 11.x releases), so I use Vim to do all my searching and find the 
beans etc. and go back to the GUI to locate them. This by itself provides a 
huge benefit, but it is often not sufficient in a huge project, because you 
still don't know how to locate it in the GUI.

My solution for sometime was to set 'foldmethod' to "indent" and after 
searching for the bean, carefully open the folds up one by one and locate the 
parents (this works because the beans are indented nicely by their level in 
the bean tree). Once you reach to the top most bean (under the root), you get 
an idea how to locate it, which solved the problem, but I still felt that it 
is a bit tedious to do this (especially because of the several folds you need 
to open up keeping track of the cursor position).

My new solution to this problem is still using folds, but in a different way 
(you need Vim 6.3). The displayName property of the beans is what we are 
interested in to locate the bean, so I create an outline of the entire bean 
structure using the following command (you need script#158 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=158], and script#171 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=171] and script#197 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=197]):

>
    FoldMatching "displayName" -1
<

This creates folds just the way I want, but provides no way to navigate the 
bean structure, so here is a function to take advantage of the fact that the 
XML is nicely indented, and find the parent bean:

>
    " This function is useful in an InstallShield XML project file to find the
    " parent bean of the current bean. Call this function after creating folds
    " using the following command:
    " FoldMatching "displayName" -1
    " This assumes that the beans are indented based on their depth in the bean
    " tree (which is the case for at least InstallShield MP 5.x)
    function! FoldMoveToParentNode()
      normal! zc
      let curNodeIndent = indent(foldclosed('.'))
      let nodeIndent = curNodeIndent
      let curLine = line('.')
      let line = -1
      while nodeIndent >= curNodeIndent
        " Move to the upper fold.
        normal! zkzc
        let line = line('.')
        if line == curLine " No more folds
          break
        endif
        let nodeIndent = indent(foldclosed('.'))
      endwhile
    endfunction
<

Put the above function in your vimrc along with installing the required 
plugins that I mentioned above, and optionally create a mapping:

>
    nnoremap \fdp :call FoldMoveToParentNode()<CR>
<

Here are the concise steps to locate beans:
    - Execute the below command: 


>
    :FoldMatching "displayName" -1
<
    - Search for the bean name or any others that you are interested in (like a 
      filename or command being executed). This will position the cursor on the fold 
      that the matching line is part of (vim might automatically open the fold, 
      depending on your 'foldopen' setting): 


>
    /\.ear
<
    - Now execute the above function (or the map) multiple times until you reach 
      the parent that is familiar to you: 


>
    :call FoldMoveToParentNode()
<

I find this very handy to quickly navigate in an installshield MP project 
(especially when it is unfamiliar), and I hope that others also find it 
useful.

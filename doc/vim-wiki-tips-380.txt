==============================================================================

There is an easy way to use gvim as somewhat like a frontend for the solaris 
dbx debugger. Add the following to your .dbxrc:

>
    alias sc=" gvim --servername DBX --remote-silent $vfile +$vlineno"
    when stop { gvim --servername DBX --remote-silent $vfile +$vlineno ;}
<

When the debugger stops it shows you the current position in gvim. The first 
stop will open a new gvim window and then every other update will reuse the 
previously opened window. My gvim doesn't take the focus, I don't know why, so 
I just can walk through the code.

The sc alias shows the current position and is helpful after loading the 
executable to show the start (we haven't stopped at this point).

It doesn't work at the first stop after attaching to a process. This is 
probably for the best though as this stop is typically in a system call with 
no source code.

ALTERNATE IMPLEMENTATION                    *vwt-380-alternate-implementation*

In order to use console Vim with similar functionality, you can simply write 
a Vim command to a file, then source the command with Vim.

So, put this in your .dbxrc:

>
    # Functions
    # Write Current, this will write a line to ~/.dbx.vim
    # which will cause vim to open the current file at the current location
    function wc {
        echo :e +$vlineno $vfile > $HOME/.dbx.vim
    }
    # Write Variables, dumps the values of all variables local to current
    # procedure into ~/.dbx.vars
    function wv {
    # dbx has a pretty bad parser, so pipes won't work within $(..), and
    # you can forget about backticks, but at least it can call shell commands
        > ~/.dbx.dump dump
        > ~/.dbx.vars
        cat ~/.dbx.dump | sed 's/ .*$//' > ~/.dbx.varnames
        for var in $(cat ~/.dbx.varnames); do
    # print only accepts one var at a time
            >> ~/.dbx.vars 2>&1 print -r $var
            if echo $(print $var) | grep "0x" > /dev/null; then
                >> ~/.dbx.vars 2>&1 print -r *$var
            fi
        done
    }
    # Vim Current, same thing, but will spawn vim
    function vc {
        vim +$vlineno $vfile
    }
    # Whens
    when stop { wc; }
    # Aliases
    # Whens
    when stop { wc; }
    # Aliases
    alias sdb="source ~/.dbxrc"
    alias w="where;wc"
    alias u="up;wc"
    alias d="down;wc"
    alias he="help"
    alias s="step;wc"
    alias su="step up;wc" # cont to next stmt in parent function
    alias n="next; wc" # cont to next stmt in same function
<

So, if you add the following lines to your .vimrc:

>
    " Open current source file according to dbx
    nmap <C-D> :source ~/.dbx.vim<CR>
    " Open listing of active dbx variables
    nmap ,v :e ~/.dbx.vars<CR>
<

Now, Ctrl-D will open the current dbx file and line (mnemonic: d for debug). 
`,v` will open up a listing of variables (mnemonic: v for variables).

With only this, you can have a pretty good debugging setup with just vim and 
dbx.

SENDING COMMANDS TO DBX FROM VIM    *vwt-380-sending-commands-to-dbx-from-vim*

If you wish to use Vim to execute dbx commands too, the easiest way I have 
found is to create an alias to source a file, then put the commands I want 
into the file, such as:

>
    # Clear out breakpoints
    delete all
    # Clear out any displayed variables
    undisplay 0
    # Set breakpoint
    stop at dbmulti.c:7043
    stop at riintfn.c:4128
    # Other commands
<

Then you just type in the alias, and the file is sourced, allowing you to 
more efficiently type in breakpoints and such using command 
completion/efficient editing in Vim.

The alias would look like

>
    alias z="source ~/.dbx.comm"
<

It should go in your `~/.dbxrc` file.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-380-comments*

I think "when stop ........" should to executed in dbx after loading the 
program/Attaching a debugger to the process. Then only it works.

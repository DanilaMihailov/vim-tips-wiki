==============================================================================

In addition to any word completion |vtw-4| you can use Ctrl-X completion mode 
to complete whole lines, filenames, keywords, and more. While entering text in 
insert mode, press Ctrl-X (written as <C-X> below), then another key to 
indicate the type of completion.
    - <C-X><C-L> complete whole lines 
    - <C-X><C-P> complete words (<C-P> has the same effect; <C-X> is not needed) 
    - <C-X><C-F> complete file names 
    - <C-X>`s` spelling suggestions (after `:setl spell` to enable spell checking) 


While completion is active, type <C-P> or <C-N> to select the previous or 
next item.

For more information, see :help |ins-completion|.

EXAMPLE                                                      *vtw-295-example*

For example, suppose the following text is entered:

>
    this is first line
    second line is here
<

With the cursor on the empty third line, and while still in insert mode, 
pressing <C-X><C-L> will insert a copy of the second line. Select another line 
with <C-P> or <C-N>.

If "th" is typed at the start of the third line, pressing <C-X><C-L> will 
insert the first line because it starts with "th".

As an example of word completion, suppose "f" is typed at the start of the 
third line. Press <C-P> to complete the word using the previous occurrence 
that starts with "f"—that will insert "first". If you then press <C-X><C-P> 
the following word will also be inserted (the result will be "first line").

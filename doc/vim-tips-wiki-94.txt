==============================================================================

When editing programs, there is often a need to jump to another location, for 
example, to see how a function is defined. To help, Vim uses a tags file that 
lists each word you are likely to want, and their locations (file path and 
line number). Each wanted word is known as a "tag", for example, each function 
name or global variable may be a tag.

The tags file has to be created by a utility, and has to be updated after 
significant editing has occurred. An alternative to manual tag generation is 
to use a plugin like vim-gutentags. This tip provides an overview of creating 
and using tags files (for the details, see :help |tagsrch.txt|).

USING TAGS                                                 *vtw-94-using-tags*

Jumping to a tag
    - You can use the 'tag' ex command. For example, the command ':tag <tagname>' 
      will jump to the tag named <tagname>. 
    - You can position the cursor over a tag name and then press Ctrl-]. 
    - You can visually select a text and then press Ctrl-] to jump to the tag 
      matching the selected text. 
    - You can click on the tag name using the left mouse button, while pressing the 
      <Ctrl> key. 
    - You can press the g key and then click on the tag name using the left mouse 
      button. 
    - You can use the 'stag' ex command, to open the tag in a new window. For 
      example, the command ':stag func1' will open the func1 definition in a new 
      window. 
    - You can position the cursor over a tag name and then press Ctrl-W ]. This 
      will open the tag location in a new window.

How do I jump to a particular tag match, if there are multiple matching tags?
    - You can use the 'tselect' ex command to list all the tag matches. For 
      example, the command ':tselect func1' will list all the locations where func1 
      is defined. You can then enter the number of a tag match to jump to that 
      location. 
    - You can position the cursor over the tag name and press g] to get a list of 
      matching tags. 
    - You can visually select a text and press g] to get a list of matching tags. 
    - You can use the 'stselect' ex command. This will open the selected tag from 
      the tag list in a new window. 
    - You can position the cursor over the tag name and press Ctrl-W g] to do a 
      :stselect.

Returning after a tag jump
    - You can use the 'pop' ex command. 
    - You can press Ctrl-t. 
    - You can click the right mouse button, while pressing the <Ctrl> key. 
    - You can press the g key and then click the right mouse button.

How do I jump again to a previously jumped tag location?
    - You can use the 'tag' ex command to jump to a previously jumped tag location, 
      which is stored in the tag stack. 


Help: tag

How do I list the contents of the tag stack?
    - Vim remembers the location from which you jumped to a tag in the tag stack. 
      You can list the current tag stack using the 'tags' ex command. 


Help: :tags, tagstack

I want to jump to a tag, if there is only one matching tag, otherwise a list 
of matching tags should be displayed. How do I do this?

There are several ways to make Vim to jump to a tag directly, if there is 
only one tag match, otherwise present a list of tag matches.
    - You can use the 'tjump' ex command. For example, the command ':tjump func1' 
      will jump to the definition func1, if it is defined only once. If func1 is 
      defined multiple times, a list of matching tags will be presented. 
    - You can position the cursor over the tag and press g Ctrl-]. 
    - You can visually select a text and press g Ctrl-] to jump or list the 
      matching tags. 
    - You can use the 'stjump' ex command. This will open the matching or selected 
      tag from the tag list in a new window. 
    - You can press Ctrl-W g Ctrl-] to do a :stjump.

How do browse through a list of multiple tag matches?

If there are multiple tag matches, you can browse through all of them using 
several of the Vim ex commands.
    - To go to the first tag in the list, use the 'tfirst' or 'trewind' ex command. 
    - To go to the last tag in the list, use the 'tlast' ex command. 
    - To go to the next matching tag in the list, use the 'tnext' ex command. 
    - To go to the previous matching tag in the list, use the 'tprevious' or 
      'tNext' ex command. 


Help: :tfirst, :trewind, :tlast, :tnext, :tprevious, :tNext

How do I preview a tag?

You can use the preview window to preview a tag, without leaving the original 
window. There are several ways to preview a tag:
    - You can use the 'ptag' ex command to open a tag in the preview window. 
    - You can position the cursor on a tag name and press Ctrl-W } to open the tag 
      in the preview window. 
    - You can use the 'ptselect' ex command to do the equivalent of the 'tselect' 
      ex command in the preview window. 
    - You can use the 'ptjump' ex command to do the equivalent of the 'tjump' ex 
      command in the preview window. 
    - You can position the cursor on the tag and press Ctrl-W g} to do a :ptjump on 
      the tag.

How do I browse through the tag list in a preview window?

If there are multiple tag matches, you can browse through all of them in the 
preview window using several of the Vim ex commands.
    - To go to the first tag in the list, use the 'ptfirst' or 'ptrewind' ex 
      command. 
    - To go to the last tag in the list, use the 'ptlast' ex command. 
    - To go to the next matching tag in the list, use the 'ptnext' ex command. 
    - To go to the previous matching tag in the list, use the 'ptprevious' or 
      'ptNext' ex command. 


Help: :ptfirst, :ptrewind, :ptlast, :ptnext, :ptprevious, :ptNext

How do I start Vim to start editing a file at a given tag match?

While starting Vim, you can use the command line option '-t' to supply a tag 
name. Vim will directly jump to the supplied tag location.

Help: -t

How do I list all the tags matching a search pattern?

There are several ways to go through a list of all tags matching a pattern.
    - You can list all the tags matching a particular regular expression pattern by 
      prepending the tag name with the '/' search character. For example, 


>
    :tag /<pattern>
    :stag /<pattern>
    :ptag /<pattern>
    :tselect /<pattern>
    :tjump /<pattern>
    :ptselect /<pattern>
    :ptjump /<pattern>
<
    - If you have the 'wildmenu' option set, then you can press the <Tab> key to 
      display a list of all the matching tags in the status bar. You can use the 
      arrow keys to move between the tags and then use the Enter key to select a 
      tag. 
    - If you don't have the 'wildmenu' option set, you can still use the <Tab> key 
      to browse through the list of matching tags. 


Help: tag-regexp, wildmenu

What options are available to control how Vim handles the tags file?

You can use the following options to control the handling of tags file by 
Vim:
    - 'tagrelative' - Controls how the file names in the tags file are treated. 
      When on, the filenames are relative to the directory where the tags file is 
      present. 
    - 'taglength' - Controls the number of significant characters used for 
      recognizing a tag. 
    - 'tagbsearch' - Controls the method used to search the tags file for a tag. If 
      this option is on, binary search is used to search the tags file. Otherwise, 
      linear search is used. 
    - 'tagstack' - Controls how the tag stack is used.

Is it possible to highlight all the tags in the current file?

Yes. Read the Vim online help on "tag-highlight".

Is there a workaround to make the Ctrl-] key not to be treated as the telnet 
escape character?

The default escape characters for telnet in Unix systems is Ctrl-]. While 
using Vim in a telnet session, if you use Ctrl-] to jump to a tag, you will 
get the telnet prompt. There are two ways to avoid this problem:
    - Map the telnet escape character to some other character using the "-e <escape 
      character>" telnet command line option 
    - Disable the telnet escape character using the "-E" telnet command line 
      option.

EXTENDING CTAGS                                       *vtw-94-extending-ctags*

Universal-ctags https://ctags.io/ [https://ctags.io/] is extended successor 
of http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/].

Following is an example of defining a language for Exuberant Ctags. IDL 
(Interactive Data Language) procedures and functions are supported by putting 
the following in your `.ctags` file:

>
    --langdef=IDL
    --langmap=IDL:.pro
    --regex-IDL=/^pro[ \t]+([a-zA-Z0-9_:]+)/\1/p,procedure/i
    --regex-IDL=/^function[ \t]+([a-zA-Z0-9_:]+)/\1/f,function/i
<

Other examples, including for LaTeX, are in the documentation 
[http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/extend.html] for the taglist 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273] plugin.

CTAGS USAGE BASIC EXAMPLES                 *vtw-94-ctags-usage-basic-examples*

>
    ctags *.c # Generate a tags file for all C files in the current directory
<

>
    ctags --recurse . # processing subdirectories recursively
<

>
    ctags -L list-of-files # Generate a tags file for all files listed in a file
<

CONFIGURING VIM                                       *vtw-94-configuring-vim*

Vim needs to be told where to look for your tags files, using the '`tags`' 
option. :help 'tags' :help |tags-option|

>
    :set tags=/my/dir/tags
<

The '`tags`' option can specify more than one tags file:

>
    :set tags=/my/dir1/tags,/my/dir2/tags
<

In a large project, it is common to have a tags file in each directory (with 
each tags file handling the files in its directory). To assist, there is a 
special case: If a file specified in '`tags`' starts with "./", the '.' is 
replaced with the path of the current file.

With this setting, the tags file is in the directory of the current file (no 
matter what the current directory is). You can define which tag file is 
searched first: In the current directory ("`tags,./tags`"), or in the 
directory of the current file ("`./tags,tags`"). You might also consider 
setting your working directory to the current file |vtw-64|.

With the following setting, Vim will search for the file named 'tags', 
starting with the directory of the current file and then going to the parent 
directory and then recursively to the directory one level above, till it 
either locates the 'tags' file or reaches the root directory. :help 
|tags-option| :help |file-searching|

    :set tags=./tags;

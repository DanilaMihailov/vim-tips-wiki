==============================================================================

You may want to list all lines in the current buffer that match a pattern, 
for example, list all lines containing "Warning". The following script copies 
all matching lines to a scratch (temporary) buffer. You can then examine the 
list, or save it to a file.

Create a file called (for example) filter.vim containing:

>
    " Gather search hits, and display in a new scratch buffer.
    function! Gather(pattern)
      if !empty(a:pattern)
        let save_cursor = getpos(".")
        let orig_ft = &ft
        " append search hits to results list
        let results = []
        execute "g/" . a:pattern . "/call add(results, getline('.'))"
        call setpos('.', save_cursor)
        if !empty(results)
          " put list in new scratch buffer
          new
          setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide noswapfile
          execute "setlocal filetype=".orig_ft
          call append(1, results)
          1d  " delete initial blank line
        endif
      endif
    endfunction
    
    " Delete the current buffer if it is a scratch buffer (any changes are lost).
    function! CloseScratch()
      if &buftype == "nofile" && &bufhidden == "hide" && !&swapfile
        " this is a scratch buffer
        bdelete
        return 1
      endif
      return 0
    endfunction
    
    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>f :call Gather(input("Search for: "))<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>F :call Gather(@/)<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <Esc> :call CloseScratch()<CR>
<

In Vim, the command `:source filter.vim` will execute the script.

Assuming the default leader key (backslash), you can now:
    - Type `\f` and enter a pattern when prompted. 
    - Type `\F` to filter on the last search pattern. 
    - Press Escape to close the scratch buffer listing the search hits. 


For example, you could put the cursor on a word and press `*` to search for 
the next occurrence of that word. If you now type `\F` a new window will open 
with a list of all lines that contain the word you searched for. Press Escape 
to close the window.

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES                       *vwt-1557-alternative-procedures*

A simple procedure to list all lines matching a pattern is:

>
    " Print all lines that contain "pattern".
    :g/pattern/p
    " Following is equivalent.
    :g/pattern
<

The following will delete all lines that do not contain a pattern, leaving 
only the search hits. You could then press `u` to undo the changes.

>
    :v/pattern/d
<

    - Folding with Regular Expression

      lines without a search pattern rather than modifying it or using a scratch

    - Copy the search results into clipboard |vwt-478| to copy matching patterns 
      (not lines) 
    - Redirect g search output |vwt-1063| uses `:redir` with `g//p` for a limited 
      one-line version of this tip 
    - List lines with current search pattern highlighted |vwt-1141| defines command 
      `PP` to highlight matches displayed with `:g//PP`

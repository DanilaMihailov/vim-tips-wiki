==============================================================================

The following settings in vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] will 
enable color highlighting when using SecureCRT and may work on other telnet 
packages. The terminal type should be selected as ANSI and color enabled.

    if !has("gui_running")
      set t_Co=8
      set t_Sf=^[[3%p1%dm
      set t_Sb=^[[4%p1%dm
    endif
<

The `^[` is entered as <Ctrl-v><Esc>

Of course this isn't what I wanted to do. I wanted to get rid of the stupid 
syntax colors by default.

But by extension: t_Co=1 does this perfectly; I just put it in my system wide 
vimrc file.

==============================================================================

I think you can enable color via SecureCRT Session Options 
:Emulation/Terminal : Linux + Ansi ColorAppearance/Current Color Scheme : 
Windows

==============================================================================

And in most cases the color problems are simply solved by:

>
    :syntax on
<

==============================================================================

In most cases the issue with color syntax on SecureCRT is the Encoding 
option. Under Terminal -> Emulation make sure you have Linux selected. Under 
Terminal -> Appearance make sure you have UTF-8 as the encoding. This step is 
often missed. You may need to add export TERM=linux to your bashrc file as 
well.

==============================================================================

See :help |xterm-color|

Replace the ^[ with a real <Esc> key (type CTRL-V ESC):

>
    if &term =~ "xterm"
        if has("terminfo")
          set t_Co=8
          set t_Sf=^[[3%p1%dm
          set t_Sb=^[[4%p1%dm
        else
          set t_Co=8
          set t_Sf=^[[3%dm
          set t_Sb=^[[4%dm
        endif
      endif

This worked perfectly for me on PuTTY. I'm not sure if anything changes for 
SecureCRT. It only give 8 colors though.

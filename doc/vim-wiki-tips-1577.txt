==============================================================================

Often, when dealing with a data file in text format (e.g. csv), we need to 
massage the data to modify, filter or rearrange it. Using a clever trick to 
recursively use Vim's complex repeats |vwt-144| (i.e. "macro recording"), such 
tasks can be done easily without having to be a REGEXpert.

Let's say we have a text file with the following contents:

>
    dr-------- 20906
    drwx------ 20913
    drwxr-x--- 20704
    drwxr-xr-x 21104
    lrwxrwxrwx 20606
    -------r-- 21004
    -rw-r----- 20716
    -rwxrwx--- 21102
<

For some reason, we want to move the 5-digit number at the end of the line to 
after the last "r" character on the same line, and we want to repeat it for 
the whole file. Notice that all these numbers begin with "2" and there can be 
multiple "r" per line.

Here's the end-result that we want:

>
    dr20906--------
    dr20913wx------
    drwxr20704-x---
    drwxr-xr21104-x
    lrwxrwxr20606wx
    -------r21004--
    -rw-r20716-----
    -rwxr21102wx---
<

Yes, this can be done via `:substitute` with back references (Try: 
`%s/\v(.+r)(.+)\s(\d{5})/\1\3\2/`), but that can be intimidating for some. An 
easier, more flexible and often quicker method to accomplish the same task is 
to use "complex repeats", which really aren't too complex.

Here's how:

With this knowledge, you can now quickly perform complex editing of any 
structured text with relative ease.

This works much the same way as typing `9999@q` to execute the 'q' register 
as many times as the count you pass, except that you do not need to think 
about the size of your file before doing so to make sure enough 9s are added.

ENDING THE RECURSION                           *vwt-1577-ending-the-recursion*

Normally, a macro recorded in this way will repeat until it reaches the end 
of the file. But, you can easily take advantage of the fact that a macro will 
stop running if it encounters an error to end the recursion when you want. For 
example, suppose you have a list of file names (perhaps you obtained it with 
`:r !ls *.c`), and you want to verify that every one of these file names 
occurs in another buffer (a makefile, for instance). You could do this quickly 
and easily as follows:
    - Format the file list to one file name per line, with each file name starting 
      at beginning of the line 
    - Split a new window with the file you wish to contain all the file names (for 
      a total of two windows) 
    - Position the cursor on the first line of the file list 
    - Record a recursive macro as follows: 


>
    qfq
    qf
    0y$
    <c-w>w
    /\V<c-r>"<cr>
    <c-w>w
    j@f
    q
<

The result is that register 'f' contains a macro that will search for every 
line of the list of file names, until it reaches the end of the list of file 
names or until it encounters an error such as "pattern not found: {filename}". 
If you run this macro on the file list, you will either see each file name 
highlighted in turn until the end of the list, or you will see a pattern not 
found error and (if 'hlsearch' is on) the missing file will be highlighted in 
the list.

If you don't wan't to rely on an error in this way to end the recursion, you 
could also do :if cond | exe 'normal @q' | endif instead of `@q` while 
recording the macro to provide a base case to end the recursion.

ADDING RECURSION TO AN EXISTING MACRO *vwt-1577-adding-recursion-to-an-existing-macro*

Forget to add the recursion as a final step, or want to debug first before 
running the macro on every line in the file? An easy solution is, after you 
have the macro doing everything but the recursive call, just append it to the 
register. Assuming that you've recorded the macro into the 'q' register, just 
do this:

>
    qQ
    @q
    q
<

This works using the uppercased character to append in the corresponding 
register, see Best Vim Tips: Appending to registers 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Best_Vim_Tips#Appending_to_registers].

NOTE                                                           *vwt-1577-note*

One may wonder, "why is it necessary to empty out a register prior to 
recording into it?" A sequence such as `qf` starts recording into an empty "f" 
register by definition. However, without emptying the register with `qfq` 
prior to recording, the register will not be empty when you add `@f` to your 
macro, and thus whatever is currently stored there will be executed, instead 
of doing nothing until you actually run the macro, as intended.

COMMENTS                                                   *vwt-1577-comments*

As said under 'Note' this approach is a little tricky because it is easy to 
'miss' prior contents of registers, which can become even more tricky when 
using viminfo (who isn't?).

Therefore, I vastly prefer recording the macro in non-recursive fashion (just 
leave off the trailing @f). Then, repeat your macro by doing general repeat 
(normalmode:) 100@q or 100@@ to repeat the last executed macro 100 times. This 
has the added benefit of being able to monitor/guide the process.

In many cases, it's both easier and faster to use the :normal command (which 
runs normal-mode commands from the command mode) in order to invoke macros. As 
an ex command, :normal can take a range of lines. In the example given at the 
top of the page, one could set the macro with `qqf2dwFrpq` -- and then move to 
the next line and perform the macro on the remainder of the file with 
`:.,$normal @q`. Since this doesn't use recursion, it's much faster -- 
especially noticeable on large files (though, of course, it still won't be as 
fast as a regex or a specialized external command).

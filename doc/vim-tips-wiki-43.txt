==============================================================================

Use the `:abbreviate` command to define abbreviations.

Abbreviations can save typing, and can improve accuracy, when you need to 
enter the same text throughout your document. You can also create 
abbreviations to automatically correct common typing errors (such as changing 
teh to the).

Examples:

:ab rtfm read the fine manual
Whenever you type 'rtfm' followed by punctuation such as a space or comma, the 'rtfm' will be expanded to 'read the fine manual'. This also happens if you type 'rtfm' then press Esc or Enter.

:ab teh the
Whenever you type the word 'teh', it will be replaced with 'the'.

:ab
List all abbreviations. A flag is shown in the first column: 'i' means the abbreviation will be used in insert mode, 'c' for command-line mode, and '!' for both modes.

:una rtfm
:unabbreviate – remove 'rtfm' from the list of abbreviations.

:abc
:abclear – remove all abbreviations.

Note: To avoid expansion in insert mode, type Ctrl-V after the last character 
of the abbreviation (on Windows, type Ctrl-Q instead of Ctrl-V).

ROUGH MERGE IN FROM 992 (NOW REMOVED) *vtw-43-rough-merge-in-from-992-(now-removed)*

The 'helpgrep' command is very useful for searching through all the files 
located in the .vim/doc directory. This command is especially useful if your 
.vim/doc directory is littered with script documentation as well as language 
specific documentation such as provided by script#614 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=614], script#826 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=826] or script#1330 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1330].

The following abbreviation provides faster access to 'helpgrep'.

>
    :cnoreabbrev H helpgrep
<

This allows me to type `:H uganda` to search for the word 'uganda' in all of 
the help files.

ROUGH MERGE IN OF COMMENTS FROM 4   *vtw-43-rough-merge-in-of-comments-from-4*

I have found myself performing a lot of Ctrl-P/Ctr-N commands on the same 
strings, and when this happens, I generally add an abbreviation, which saves 
me a keystroke or two. I do a lot of programming in ColdFusion, and I have 
these lines in my .vimrc:

>
    ab Attr Attributes
    ab Appl Application
    ab Vari Variables
    ab Req Request
    ab CFQ CFQUERY
    ab CFO CFOUTPUT
    ...
<

Vim will finish the word as soon as you type a character after the 
abbreviation.

==============================================================================

Example of a multiline abbreviation:

>
    :ab mul Multiple<CR>lines
<

==============================================================================

To move the cursor to a certain position after the abbreviation, try one of 
these:

>
    ?ab<enter>
<

Where ab is the letters at the position you want (search backwards).

>
    Nb
<

Where N is the number of words you want to go back. For example, 7b will take you back 7 words.

==============================================================================

To get a C-style comment when you type 'com', you can add this to your .vimrc 
file:

>
    iab com /*<CR><CR>/<Up>
<

which will expand to:

>
    /*
     * <here-is-the-cursor-position>
     */
<

==============================================================================

Here are some useful abbreviations for Java code:

>
    abbr psvm public static void main(String[] args){<CR>}<esc>O
    abbr sysout System.out.println("");<esc>2hi
    abbr sop System.out.println("");<esc>2hi
    abbr syserr System.err.println("");<esc>2hi
    abbr sep System.err.println("");<esc>2hi
    
    abbr forl for (int i = 0; i < ; i++) {<esc>7hi
    abbr tryb try {<CR>} catch (Exception ex) {<CR> ex.printStackTrace();<CR>}<esc>hx3ko
    abbr const public static final int
    
    abbr ctm System.currentTimeMillis()
    abbr slept try {<CR> Thread.sleep();<CR>}<esc>hxA catch(Exception ex) {<CR> ex.printStackTrace();<CR>}<esc>hx3k$hi
<

==============================================================================

AUTOMATICALLY ADD ABBREVIATIONS IN A FILE *vtw-43-automatically-add-abbreviations-in-a-file*

If you wish to enter your abbreviations automatically in a file, without the 
need to open it, then use the following function :

>
    "------------------------------
    "mapping to automatically add an
    "abbreviation
    fun AddAbbr()
        normal byw
        let StringChar = lh#visual#selection()
        "where lh#visual#selection() is a function you have to download from here :
        "http://lh-vim.googlecode.com/svn/vim-lib/tags/2.2.1/autoload/lh/visual.vim
        "and then, to put in your .vim/autoload directory.
        let val = input("Enter the abbreviation you wish to use for '" . StringChar . "' :")
        exec "ia" val StringChar
        silent call SaveAbbr(StringChar, val)
    endfun
    
    fun SaveAbbr(val, abbr)
        redir >>~/.vim/foo.txt
        "foo.txt is the file in which you wish to add your abbreviations. For me, it
        "is ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim
        echo "iab" a:abbr a:val
        redir END
    endfun
    
    vmap <S-F8> <ESC>:call AddAbbr()<CR>
    "Replace S-F8 by any other shortcut you wish
<

Copy it in your .vimrc file, and read the comments. Basically, you have to 
download the file located here 
[http://lh-vim.googlecode.com/svn/vim-lib/tags/2.2.1/autoload/lh/visual.vim] 
and to copy it in the relevant directory. Then, select a word or an expression 
in visual mode, and push Shift+F8.

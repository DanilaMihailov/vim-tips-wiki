==============================================================================

When opening a new file with :edit or :split, you may want to create the 
directory the file will reside in. This can be done in autocommand BufNewFile 
(add to vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] in any Unix-like system with 
mkdir that accepts -p switch).

TO DO This tip is rather dodgy for those of us who sometimes make mistakes. I 
don't think it should automatically create possibly several directories as a 
result of a simple typo in the :edit /path/file command.

The tip should instead provide a specific command to create a path and edit a 
file (you would know that using the command may create unwanted directories if 
you made a typo).

I believe that the md/mkdir in any Windows with cmd.exe (possibly not NT4) 
will make intermediate directories without needing -p or any other option.

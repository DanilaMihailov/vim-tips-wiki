==============================================================================

Here is how to open files in new tabs, instead of new instances of gvim, 
under Unix. It works even when you mouse click to open files in a file 
manager.

DESKTOP ENTRY                                         *vwt-1552-desktop-entry*

In the `gvim.desktop` desktop file (`/usr/share/applications/` for most 
GNU/Linux systems) look for the "Exec" line. It will probably be like this:

>
    Exec=gvim -f %F
<

Change the Exec line to:

>
    Exec=gvim -p --remote-tab-silent %F
<

You may also need to change the StartupNotify value to "false" if it is 
currently set "true", or your Vim may not respond properly when the file is 
already open in a tab 
[http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/browse_thread/thread/900bd471bc11a423].

Note: Be aware that the desktop file is changed when you install a new 
version of gvim, so you may need to repeat the following change after an 
update.

ALIAS                                                         *vwt-1552-alias*

You can of course also use an `alias`:

>
    % alias gvim='gvim -p --remote-tab-silent'
<

Most GUI programs don't read aliases, but it is useful if you start gvim from 
the shell.

AUTOMATIC DESKTOP IDENTIFICATION USING SHELL SCRIPT *vwt-1552-automatic-desktop-identification-using-shell-script*

If you want to automatically open into the gvim window on the current 
desktop, use the following bash script:

>
    #!/bin/bash
    
    this=$(basename $0); # vim|gvim|rvim etc...
    desktop=desktop_$(xprop -root -notype  _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | perl -pe 's/.*?= (\d+)/$1/')
    
    if [ $# != 0 ]; then
    	exec /usr/bin/$this --servername $desktop --remote-tab-silent "$@"
    elif ! vim --serverlist | grep -iq $desktop; then
    	exec /usr/bin/$this --servername $desktop
    fi
<

(script originally from https://gist.github.com/966205 
[https://gist.github.com/966205])

Save this bash script as /usr/local/bin/gvim to override the global Vim 
installation, which it will call into (assuming your global installation is in 
/usr/bin).

The script queries the X server for the current desktop, queries Vim for 
running Vim instances with --serverlist. When you run this script it will open 
a file in a new tab in an existing gvim window on the current desktop, or open 
new one if no gvim window exists on the current desktop, using --servername in 
both cases to specify a name for the new Vim instance which is specific to the 
current desktop. If no file was given and gvim is already running on the 
desktop, the script does nothing.

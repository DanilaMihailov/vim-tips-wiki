==============================================================================

There is probably an easier way to do this, but, if I cannot find an easy 
solution for a given problem, I just devise one that works for the meantime -- 
which usually becomes permanent.

This function comments out lines according to file type. So if a file is .sh, 
it uses # to comment lines. And if a file is type .c it will start the 
comments with /* and end them with */.

Put these lines in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] file:

>
    " comment out highlighted lines according to file type
    " put a line like the following in your ~/.vim/filetype.vim file
    " and remember to turn on filetype detection: filetype on
    " au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.sh,*.tcl,*.php,*.pl let Comment="#"
    " if the comment character for a given filetype happens to be @
    " then use let Comment="\@" to avoid problems...
    function CommentLines()
      "let Comment="#" " shell, tcl, php, perl
      exe ":s@^@".g:Comment."@g"
      exe ":s@$@".g:EndComment."@g"
    endfunction
    " map visual mode keycombo 'co' to this function
    vmap co :call CommentLines()<CR>
<

In filetype.vim [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Filetype.vim] you can add things 
such as:

>
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.inc,*.ihtml,*.html,*.tpl,*.class set filetype=php
            \ | let Comment="<!-- " | let EndComment=" -->"
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.sh,*.pl,*.tcl let Comment="#" | let EndComment=""
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.js set filetype=html | let Comment="//" | let EndComment=""
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.cc,*.php,*.cxx let Comment="//" | let EndComment=""
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.c,*.h let Comment="/*" | let EndComment="*/"
<

All set, now whenever you are editing a file of those you have defined in 
your filetype.vim script, you can just go into Visual mode, highlight what you 
want to comment out, and type "co". Simple.

COMMENTS  *vwt-355-comments*

I was used to using 'boxes' as an external filter to comment/decomment, but 
pushing to the program and back is more 'expensive' then using a simple 
script, but boxes really is better then EnhancedCommentify.vim (at least I 
haven't found a way yet to make it behave just like I want it to.).

But I would prefer a maintained thing any day.

==============================================================================

The first filetype autocmd uses set filetype=php instead of setf php, which 
could cause it to replace the filetype (depending on where in the runtime path 
and file it's placed). It's also the only one which changes a filetype (and it 
does so a bit overzealously, not all .inc or .class files are php).

I think the setf can be removed altogether, or moved into a different tip, at 
least.

In fact, these would probably be better in vimrc autocmds as

>
    au FileType php  let Comment="<!-- " | let EndComment=" -->"
<

et al. Let the pre-flow evaluate the filetype, and the post-flow define the 
comment fields.

Or probably even after/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim syntax modification files.

This tip is deprecated for the following reasons:

If you're using IPython [http://ipython.org] 0.11 or newer, have a look at 
vim-ipython [https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython]. It ships with ipython, 
provides bidirectional interface between vim and ipython, and works on all 
platforms.

IPython and Vim make for a great IDE. The following shortcuts can help to 
make it even better.

To also avoid having to enter a test command in IPython, I use konsole and 
dcop to send the command to IPython automatically. In the following, ' is 
mapped to run the command 'r' in IPython. First, start IPython as follows:

>
    konsole --script
    ipython
<

Next, add the following mapping to vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    nnoremap ' :wa<CR>:!dcop konsole-`pidof konsole` session-1 sendSession r<CR><CR>
<

I wanted to make this work in gnome-terminal as well, but couldn't figure out 
how to do this with DBUS. So here's a nice trick to make it work in any 
terminal that supports the 'screen' utility. First, create a 'virtual' screen 
named 'blah':

>
    screen -S blah
    ipython
<

Now to send a command to the 'blah' screen:

>
    nnoremap ' :wa<CR>:!screen -x blah -X stuff $'r\n'<CR><CR>
<

To start screen with gnome-terminal:

>
    gnome-terminal -e 'screen -S blah'
<

Please feel free to add more tips for integration with IPython below.

I used the following script:

>
    " maps ' to save and run the current buffer in the ipython session
    nnoremap ' :wa<CR>:!screen -x ipython_vim -X stuff $'\%run "%:p"\n'<CR><CR>
    
    " opens a new konsole window with ipython running in screen
    com OpenIPython :!konsole -e screen -S ipython_vim ipython

WINDOWS                                                     *vtw-1551-windows*

Find `ipythonrc.ini` and in this file find this line:

>
    editor 0
<

and change this line to this line:

>
    editor gvim -f
<

In `ipythonrc.ini` the hash symbol (#) means comments as in Python. Be aware 
that there are two `ipythonrc.ini` files: one in the installation directory, 
the other in C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>; one needs to modify the 
file in <Documents and Settings> and not in the installation directory for the 
effects to take place.

After doing these modifications, restart IPython and type:

>
    %edit
<

and gvim will start.

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1551-comments*

I tried this on Windows, and when I type %edit in IPython it opens Notepad 
and not gvim.

It works with:

>
    ipython profile create
    # creates ipython_config.py in document and settings/username/.ipython
    Then edit this file to replace
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor = 'notepad'
    with
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor = 'gvim -f'
<

Restart ipython, then `%edit` should work.

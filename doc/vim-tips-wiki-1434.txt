==============================================================================

This tip is for those who edit Makefiles by hand.

Makefiles punish you if instead of single tab somebody puts eight spaces in 
your makefile (happens when pasting between Makeiles). This script guards 
against this annoying pitfall.

The following script auto-converts 8 spaces at the beginning of line (only in 
Makefiles, and only at the beginning of line) into tab, as you type or paste. 
It is suggested to have `:set list` in Makefiles, too. This script will only 
work if `:set nopaste` is set.

    function! MapSpaceInMakefile()
      " if this space is 8th space from the beginning of line, replace 8 spaces with
      " one tab (only at the beginning of file)
      let line = getline('.')
      let col = col('.')
      if strpart(line, 0, 8) == ' '
        let new = "\t" . strpart(line,8)
        call setline('.', new )
      endif
      return ""

You don't need a script for this! Use the substitution command:

>
    :%s/^ \{8}/^V<Tab>/
<

^V<Tab> means pressing CTRL-V and the press the <Tab>-key, or s/^ 
\{8}/^Q<Tab>/ on Windows.

==============================================================================

Your command above does not fix as you type.

==============================================================================

A competent programmer should not err when typing. It is more likely to occur 
on paste, when one generally will ':set paste'.

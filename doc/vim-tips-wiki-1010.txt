==============================================================================

Developers and users will often have a need to change one pattern of text to 
match a different pattern. This can be completed using a key map and a regular 
expression. For example some development requires developers to be MISRA 
compliant. One of the MISRA rules is `//-style-comments` are not acceptable. 
These occurrences must be replaced by `/*-style-comments-*/`. Adding the 
following mapping to the vimrc file will do this per line.

>
    :map <F5> /\/\/<CR>xxi/*<Esc>A*/<Esc>
<

This will do the action per found line. Start at the beginning of the file, 
and repeatedly press <F5>. Alternatively, this regular expression can be used:

>
    :map <F5> %s,//\(.*\),/*\1 */,
<

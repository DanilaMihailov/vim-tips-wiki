Let's say you have some C or Java that looks like this:

>
    // get the age of the person
    age = person.getAge();
<

If you want to compact your code a bit you might want to stick the comment at 
the end of the statement instead of on its own line. Essentially you want to 
"join up":

>
    map <C-S-j> kddpkJ
<

Used on the example above by placing the cursor on the second line and typing 
ctrl-shift-j, you will now have:

>
    age = person.getAge(); // get the age of the person
<

`ddp` is used to swap the lines before joining, so the comment line is at the 
end of the newly joined line.

COMMENTS                                                   *vwt-1050-comments*

A better way of swapping lines is to use

>
    :m+
    :m-2
<

Hence, modifying "map <C-S-j> kddpkJ" and maintaining cursor position:

>
    nmap <C-S-j> mz:m-2<CR>J`z
<

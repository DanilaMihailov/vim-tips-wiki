Vim 6 has this cool client-server protocol. I use it all the time to edit a 
file in an existing gvim, like so

>
    $ gvim --remote [filename]
<

Today I left myself logged in at the console at work, and when I got home I 
realized I had left vim running with files unsaved. I think I even left it in 
insert mode. I wanted to edit these files at home. So I ssh'd to the machine 
and started playing with the --remote commands.

The Vim help was a bit cryptic:

>
    --remote-send {keys} Send {keys} to server and exit.
<

After a lot of failed attempts, I finally succeeded in getting the remote vim 
to save its buffers and quit.

>
    $ DISPLAY=:0 vim --servername GVIM --remote-send '<Esc>:wqa<CR>'
<

A couple of notable things. The environment variable DISPLAY has to be the 
display of the remote vim, and you have to be able to open that display. The 
client-server stuff is done through X.

The <CR> is important. This part eluded me for a long time. The {keys} are 
just like keys you would press if you were editing at the console, and you 
have to press enter, or vim won't do anything.

Check your .swp files to make sure Vim really closed the files it was 
editing. Vim provides little feedback as to the success or failure of what 
you're trying to do remotely. Nonetheless, it's clearly a useful feature to 
have available.

To get better feedback you can use the :redir command to redirect messages to 
a file, like this:

>
    vim --servername GVIM --remote-send ':redir >> outputfile<CR>'
<

You can also evaluate remote expressions:

>
    vim --servername GVIM --remote-expr 'mode()'
<

this will tell you what mode vim is currently in and

>
    vim --servername GVIM --remote-expr 'getcwd()'
<

will tell you what directory vim is working in

==============================================================================

I never have to worry about leaving a file open, unsaved. I used to do that a 
lot, and have developed a nervous habbit of saving a LOT.

If you are like me, and don't have to worry about that, then you can simply 
type "killall vim", and all open vim's will close themselfs. If you just want 
to kill one type "ps -ef | grep vim" to find the pid. You can then type "kill 
1234" where 1234 is the pid.

==============================================================================

vim keeps swp files for all opened files. Just kill the vim process that 
bothers you, then open the file through your ssh connection. You will be 
prompted with several options, choose 'R' to recover. Save your file as 
something else, just to be sure, and then sort things out with the .swp file.

Instead off killing vim, reptyr can reattach a running vim session to the 
current terminal: https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr

It works wonders when for some reason my SSH session is interrupted.

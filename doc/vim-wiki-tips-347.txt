==============================================================================

To format the current paragraph:
    - gqap
    - gwap same, but restores cursor position


COMMENTS  *vwt-347-comments*

TO DO
    - Thanks to anon who pointed out that gwap makes the original tip obsolete (I have removed it).
    - We don't have any other tips that explain basics of paragraph formatting, so this may as well be it.
    - Need to explain what "format" means here.
    - Need to mention textwidth, formatexpr, formatprg and probably more (but keep it simple).

This tip is about how to resize Windows |usr_08.txt| efficiently.

You can use the :resize command or its shortcut :res to change the height of 
the window. To change the height to 60 rows, use:

>
    :resize 60
<

You can also change the height in increments. To change the height by 
increments of 5, use:

>
    :res +5
    :res -5
<

You can use :vertical resize to change the width of the current window. To 
change the width to 80 columns, use:

>
    :vertical resize 80
<

You can also change the width in increments. To change the width by 
increments of 5, use:

>
    :vertical resize +5
    :vertical resize -5
<

For a split window: You can use Ctrl-w + and Ctrl-w - to resize the height of 
the current window by a single row. For a vsplit window: You can use Ctrl-w > 
and Ctrl-w < to resize the width of the current window by a single column. 
Additionally, these key combinations accept a count prefix so that you can 
change the window size in larger steps. [e.g. Ctrl-w 10 + increases the window 
size by 10 lines]

To resize all windows to equal dimensions based on their splits, you can use 
Ctrl-w =.

To increase a window to its maximum height, use Ctrl-w _.

To increase a window to its maximum width, use Ctrl-w |.

To resize in different steps, you can create maps that will adjust the window 
size differently. For example to increase the window size by a factor of 1.5 
and decrease the window size by 0.67, you can map this:

>
    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>+ :exe "resize " . (winheight(0) * 3/2)<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>- :exe "resize " . (winheight(0) * 2/3)<CR>
<

In Gvim and vim in terminals with mouse support, it is also possible to use 
the mouse to resize a window. Simply grab the statusline at the window border 
and drag it into the desired direction.

The following plugins allow to define submodes, that make it possible to use 
e.g. Ctrl-W + to increase the window size and keep on increasing as long as 
you keep '+' pressed:

==============================================================================

Perhaps the most useful thing I do in Windows editing (be it in MS Word or 
Notepad-variant) is to hold down both Ctrl-Shift keys and press either 
up/down/left/right arrow keys or Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys to select an 
area that could encompass word-by-word, line-by-line or page-by-page. This 
allows me to quickly edit or delete my text. This feature is prominent in 
Windows and I find myself using it too often with any edit box, like in a web 
browser or chat messenger.

Also, holding down the Ctrl key and pressing either Backspace or Delete keys 
delete word-by-word.

The features mentioned above work differently and are somewhat clumsy in Vim 
- requiring many keystrokes and often a change from insert to normal mode and 
back from visual. Some features do not exist. Hence, I thought of combining 
these features with Vim as a way of bringing Vim closer to the standard 
editing tools most textboxes have. Plus, this would be a great way for new 
users to get acquainted with Vim.

These mappings utilize the Ctrl & Shift keys that may *NOT* work with 
terminal versions of Vim. They SHOULD work with GVim.

I have set up these mappings to work just the way I would like it to do. They 
may not conform to how it actually is when the same keystrokes are performed 
in another editor (e.g. textboxes in Windows or X11). Try it and see if you 
like it :)

No, v<End><C-d><End> is not the same as v<PageDown>. Both <End>'s are 
necessary to give its effect. I'm slightly dissatisfied with the <C-Del> 
mapping done when the cursor is at the end of a line. It pulls the next line 
up and _deletes the first word_. Any ideas on how to prevent it from taking 
the first word, but still take the eol?

What is the point of this? Vim's power lies in its modality. If you don't use 
Vim's modes, there are lots of editors out there that are better for your use. 
Kate (*nix) and Textpad (Win32) comes to mind.

But if you want to use a really powerful editor, I suggest learning to use 
Vim like it's supposed to be used. After a while what seemed strange at first 
starts making sense, and you will find out how great a modal editor is.

==============================================================================

Cream for Vim (http://cream.sf.net [http://cream.sf.net]) has similar 
functionality within insert mode, if you like single-mode editing (as this tip 
suggests). But this is not the "Vim way" which is less right-brained/visual 
and more left-brained/calculated.

==============================================================================

    :imap <S-BS> <Esc>v0di
    :map <S-BS> b
    :map <C-BS> <BS>0
<

The problem is I forget my esoteric mappings, unless they areintuitive and 
require no switching from left to right brain.

==============================================================================

I can't seem to use or map my HOME key. It sends me to the top of my window 
no mater what I try. Is this b/c I'm using terminal vim in unix/CDE? It seems 
that the operating system gets the HOME and END keys before vim does. Is there 
anything I can do? In gvim my keys work fine.

==============================================================================

Things start to get funky in terminal Vim. A lot of the control-key (Ctrl, 
Shift, Alt) functionality is either lost or varies between different operating 
systems.

I use rxvt on the SunOS unix/CDE with the environmental variable $TERM=dtterm 
when I have a color terminal. I have this in my vimrc file:

>
    "Home, End, BackSpace, Shift-arrow & Shift-function keys for color terminals
    if &term == "dtterm"
      set t_kh=<Esc>[7~ t_@7=<Esc>[8~ t_kb=<Esc> t_%i=<Esc>[c t_#4=<Esc>[d <S-Up>=<Esc>[a <S-Down>=<Esc>[b
      set <S-F1>=<Esc>[23~ <S-F2>=<Esc>[24~ <S-F3>=<Esc>[25~ <S-F4>=<Esc>[26~ <S-F5>=<Esc>[28~ <S-F6>=<Esc>[29~ <S-F7>=<Esc>[31~ <S-F8>=<Esc>[32~ <S-F9>=<Esc>[33~
    endif
<

Note that the character that come after every '=' sign for the "set" options 
is the ESC key character. To enter it within vim, type <Ctrl-V> and then hit 
<Esc> - you will get ^[It should look like "set t_kh=^[[7~" on vim.

See :help |terminal-options|.

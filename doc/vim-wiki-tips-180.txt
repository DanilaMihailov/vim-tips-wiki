==============================================================================

Ever tried to write/debug your own filetype/syntax plugin?

It's an iterative process which involves editing plugin code and testing it 
on some sample file. To see changes you made in your plugin simply do :e on 
sample file.

This will force Vim to reload all buffer-specific files, including your 
plugin.

COMMENTS  *vwt-180-comments*

This tip really oversimplifies the issue.

Your plugin may be designed to only run once per buffer, no matter how many 
times that buffer has ":e" run on it. Also, if you remove a mapping or option 
setting from your plugin, and then just call ":e" on your sample buffer, the 
mapping will still be there, as no commands were run to clear it out.

The absolutely most effective way I can think of to test your plugin is to 
edit it in one instance of Vim, and another instance of Vim for testing the 
plugin. As you save changes to your plugin, you'll need to exit and restart 
the "test" instance of vim. Luckily, vim has a very fast startup time :)

There may be other less brute-force methods of doing this. If anyone has any 
suggestions, please add them.

==============================================================================

Another issue to keep in mind, especially if ever plan on sharing your plugin 
with others is the convention of having a:

>
    if exists("loaded_typecorr")
     finish
    endif
    let loaded_typecorr = 1
<

as is suggested by ':h write-plugin' an searching for 'NOT LOADING'.

And I quote:"This also avoids that when the script is loaded twice it would 
cause errormessages for redefining functions and cause trouble for 
autocommands that areadded twice."

==============================================================================

What I do to reduce the number of times I have to restart Vim when debugging 
is use the recommended multiple loading check with the additional check of a 
global debug variable specific to your plugin. For example:

>
    if exists ("plugin_name_loaded") && !exists ("g:plugin_name_debug_mode")
     finish
    endif
    let plugin_name_loaded = 1
<

==============================================================================

This works as long as you are only adding new functions/mapping or changing 
existing functions/mappings (defined with the ! method). But that's the case 
most of the time, so while debugging, you can just :so plugin_file without 
quitting the Vim you are testing with. If you delete functions/maps, you'll 
have to restart as the previous note mentioned.

==============================================================================

ALTERNATIVE: RELOAD.VIM PLUG-IN  *vwt-180-alternative:-reload.vim-plug-in*

The reload.vim plug-in [http://peterodding.com/code/vim/reload/] (script#3148 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3148]) performs automatic 
reloading of most types of Vim scripts, i.e. (file-type) plug-ins, 
auto-load/syntax/indent scripts and color schemes.

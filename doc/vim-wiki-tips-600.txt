==============================================================================

Sometimes I need to use the name of the file that I'm editing in another 
application (compiler, e-mail attachment, reference in a document, etc).

These mappings are useful for copying the file name to the clipboard.

    " Convert slashes to backslashes for Windows.
    if has('win32')
      nmap ,cs :let @*=substitute(expand("%"), "/", "\\", "g")<CR>
      nmap ,cl :let @*=substitute(expand("%:p"), "/", "\\", "g")<CR>
    
      " This will copy the path in 8.3 short format, for DOS and Windows 9x
      nmap ,c8 :let @*=substitute(expand("%:p:8"), "/", "\\", "g")<CR>
    else
      nmap ,cs :let @*=expand("%")<CR>
      nmap ,cl :let @*=expand("%:p")<CR>
    endif
<

This maps the following keys:
    - ,cs copies just the filename. 
    - ,cl copies the filename including its full path. 
    - ,c8 copies the filename in 8.3 format for DOS and Windows 9x 


You can then simply paste the name into another document using the regular 
paste command.

COPYING TO THE GNOME CLIPBOARD        *vwt-600-copying-to-the-gnome-clipboard*

Under linux, the script above will copy the file path or filename to X Server 
clipboard (accessed by pressing the middle mouse button). To copy text to the 
Gnome Clipboard instead replace the following lines:

>
    nmap ,cs :let @*=expand("%")<CR>
      nmap ,cl :let @*=expand("%:p")<CR>
<

with

>
    nmap ,cs :let @+=expand("%")<CR>
      nmap ,cl :let @+=expand("%:p")<CR>
<



This uses the + register instead of the * register.



Note: this may work with KDE and XCFE as well, I simply haven't tested (yet).

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-600-comments*

I find it useful to have mappings both for copying the (full) path of the 
current file to the system clipboard and to the Vim unnamed register, as well 
as to copy the short name to the unnamed register:

>
    nnor ,cf :let @*=expand("%:p")<CR>    " Mnemonic: Copy File path
      nnor ,yf :let @"=expand("%:p")<CR>    " Mnemonic: Yank File path
      nnor ,fn :let @"=expand("%")<CR>      " Mnemonic: yank File Name
<

I've never felt the need to copy the short file name to the clipboard, since 
in most cases the full path will work the same or better.

The short file name (without the path) needs :t expand("%:t")

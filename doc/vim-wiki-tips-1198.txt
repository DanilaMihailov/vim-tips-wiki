==============================================================================

Many times you would be happy with the text scrolling automatically at a 
convenient speed. This helps in places where the text is for reading only 
(like an ebook), where our only interaction will be scrolling the text. I 
believe, this might help in speed-reading habits also.

To enable automatic scrolling:

>
    :map <F8> <C-E>:sleep 3500m<CR>j<F8>
<

Press <F8> to start auto scrolling. Adjust the speed in the sleep argument. 
Press Ctrl-C to stop scrolling.

This would be a great feature if added to Vim itself. Imagine a key, such as 
SHIFT-K, which when pressed starts scrolling the text upwards. Pressing it 
again, increases the speed. Pressing SPACE stops the scrolling. A SHIFT-J 
would do the reverse, that is scroll downwards.

==============================================================================

I couldn't see any reason for the ^[ so I deleted it. If anyone can think of 
why the original was map <F8> <C-E>:sleep 3500m<CR>^[j<F8> please say so (^[ 
is <Esc>).

Of course Shift-K and Shift-J (K and J) have useful meanings already, so you 
would probably want to use different keys.

I love the abbreviations in Vim, but sometimes, especially when writing 
Strings there might be a small Problem: words in the Strings matching my 
keywords are expanded.

Here are some small snippets, which helped me dealing with keywords in 
Strings.

First off all the functions. JAVA_EatChar is taken from the vim helpfiles and 
removes the character trigering the expansion. JAVA_insert_p is a predicate 
which checks whether we are typing a String or not.

JAVA_replace executes name or repl:
    - `name` is a short String being executed, if you are in a String. 
    - `repl` is to be executed, when you want your expansion. 


>
    func! JAVA_EatChar(pat)
      let c=nr2char(getchar())
      return (c =~ a:pat) ? '' : c
    endfunc
    
    func! JAVA_insert_p()
      exec "normal i \e"
      let modeVal=synIDattr( synIDtrans( synID(line("."), col("."), 0)), "name")
      return modeVal!=?"Constant" && modeVal!=?"Comment"
    endfunc
    
    func! JAVA_replace(name, repl)
      if JAVA_insert_p()
        exec a:repl
        return ""
      else
        exec a:name
        return " "
      endif
    endfunc
<

Here are some mappings:

>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> for for<C-R>=JAVA_replace("", "normal i(){\n}\ekf(\el")<CR><C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> fori for(int i=0;;i++){<CR>}<Esc>k^f;a<C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> forint for(int){<CR>}<Esc>kf)i
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> foriti for(Iterator i=;i.hasNext();){<CR>}<Esc>kf=a<C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> forit for(Iterator){<CR>}<Esc>kf)i
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> while while<C-R>=JAVA_replace("", "normal i(){\n}\ekf(\el")<CR><C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> sysout <C-R>=JAVA_replace("normal isysout", "normal iSystem.out.println();\eF)")<CR><C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> syserr <C-R>=JAVA_replace("normal isyserr", "normal iSystem.err.println();\eF)")<CR><C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> privfun private(){<CR>}<Esc>kf(i
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> pubfun public(){<CR>}<Esc>kf(i
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> profun protected(){<CR>}<Esc>kf(i
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> tryc try{<CR>}catch(){}<Esc>F)i<C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
    iabbrev <silent> <buffer> trya try{<CR>}catch(Exception e){}<Esc>O<C-R>=JAVA_EatChar('\s')<CR>
<

I'm using JAVA_replace for `for while sysout syserr`, but not for others, for 
example `fori forint`.

This is very important, because if you define e.g. `fori` with JAVA_replace 
the expansion will be executed with "exec" which will call the abbreviation 
for "for", thus unfortunatelly defining abbreviation for keywords which extend 
other keywords will become some kind of tricky.

But since the functions don't do any syntax checking by themself, it won't be 
difficult to apply them to any other language.

Abbreviations have been obsoleted by completion from dictionaries and tags in 
Vim. Then map <Tab> to do completion.

That way nothing to remember, and your abbreviations are dynamic (nothing 
static to remember).

==============================================================================

I'm sure abbreviations have NOT been rendered obsolete -- they are a great 
aid for autocorrection and macros; it's nice to be able to type 'sunita' and 
have it automatically capitalize it to 'Sunita' without having to do any extra 
work. Similarly:

iab mdy <c-r>=strftime("%B %d, %Y")<CR>

Inserts the current date (for example, "April 15, 2005") and is great for 
timestamp purposes.

Forgive the slightly tangential response, but this isn't the first time I've 
had the dubious privilege of seeing someone's submissions hacked to pieces by 
Sunita.

I think abbreviations that only trigger when one isn't in a string are very 
cool. The only thing I would suggest is to make a custom ISafeAbbrev command 
or something that takes a <lhs> and a <rhs> and executes the entire iabbrev 
with JAVA_replace etc, allowing the user to simply call it with the <lhs> and 
the two <rhs> (one for string mode, one for not) or some such.

==============================================================================

The problem with completion using dictionaries or tabs is, that they only 
expand to words, whereas using abbreviation you can map something like "for" 
to be expanded as:

>
    for (){
    }
<

in finally set the cursor in the parenthesis or "foriti" will expand to:

>
    for(Iterator i=;i.hasNext();){
    }
<

and place the cursor directly after "=".

This works, cause you can use any keymappings to abbreviations like <Esc>.

This way you can even map the word "write" in input mode to the command ":w" 
and remove the word "write" (being done automatically)

Can you do something like this with dictionaries?

I agree, for completion of other keywords, functions, using dictionaries and 
tags is very smart too, but you can't easily map whole code blocks to em.

==============================================================================

If you are interested in more advanced (and definitely more complex when you 
look at the internals) smart-abbreviations, you may have a look at what I have 
done in my C&C++ ftplugins (script#336 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=336]). All the functions 
used to provide the abbreviations and mappings are available on their own in a 
set of standalone (API) plugins (script#50 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=50]).

The C-ftplugin part should be usable in Java, and a portion of the C++ part 
is easily adaptable to Java.

I have to agree that dictionaries are not enough.

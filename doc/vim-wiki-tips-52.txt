==============================================================================

When you are displaying more than one window, you can set the scrollbind 
option in each window so they scroll together.

In each window that should scroll simultaneously, enter the command:

>
    :set scrollbind
<

You can enter scb as an abbreviation for scrollbind, and the ! flag causes 
:set to toggle a boolean option. Therefore, it is convenient to enter the 
following to toggle scrollbind on or off:

>
    :set scb!
<

When you scroll a window which has 'scrollbind' set, all other 'scrollbind' 
windows are scrolled the same amount, if possible.

...and, if your scrollbound windows ever get out of sync, in gvim it's 
possible to adjust them, as follows: scrolling the window (by any means) will 
scroll all scrollbound windows together, but scrolling a window (by means of 
its scrollbar) won't scroll the other one(s) with it. — Tonymec

technique also works with standard VIM when you have mouse controls enabled 
and using the mouse-wheel to scroll the inactive window(s).

==============================================================================

This tip is deprecated for the following reasons:

At some point, the MyDiff function provided by the Vim without Cream 
installer has been modified. As of Vim 7.3.138 it is still broken, but this 
tip is no longer completely accurate in describing deficiencies of the MyDiff 
function

Vim is able to "diff" files (show the differences between similar files) 
using an external diff program (Vim assumes you have a working diff program 
that is not part of the Vim source). :help |diff|

On Unix-based systems, Vim should work without problem because there should 
be a "standard" diff program available. However, on other systems, some tricks 
may be required in order to have Vim find your diff program. Furthermore, the 
version of diff that you use may be different from that expected by Vim, for 
example, it may require different command line options. A common way of 
handling that situation is explained at :help |diff-diffexpr| where an example 
shows a `MyDiff()` function that can pass any required command line to your 
diff program.

On Windows, many people use the "Windows Vim installers without Cream" setup 
package to install Vim. That package (see below 
|vwt-416-vim-distribution-from-cream| for details) has a bug in the way that 
diff is installed. In addition, many other Windows users try to apply the 
`MyDiff()` advice, and can encounter similar issues, even if using a Vim from 
some other source.

This tip explains how Windows users can overcome problems running diff from 
within Vim. In addition, some of the options available when invoking diff are 
explained.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION                            *vwt-416-recommended-solution*

The best solution for Windows users is to download the GnuWin32 diff 
[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm] package and install 
the "Complete package, except sources Setup". You also need to adjust your 
PATH environment variable to include the installed bin directory. 
Alternatively, you can copy the *.exe and *.dll files from that bin directory 
to another directory that is already in your PATH. The current version of 
GnuWin32 diff is 2.8.7.

Then make sure that you do not configure Vim to use the '`diffexpr`' option. 
For example, in your vimrc, you could delete lines that set `diffexpr`, or 
that define a `MyDiff()` function. Or, you could manually enter the following 
to clear the option:

>
    :set diffexpr=
<

When `diffexpr` is not set, Vim will assume you have a standard diff program 
in your PATH, and all diffs will work correctly (if the first diff program 
found in the current directory or the directories listed in your PATH is in 
fact GnuWin32 diff).

If you have installed from the "Windows Vim installers without Cream" 
download, you probably have a `diff.exe` (GnuWin32 diff 2.7) in the vim72 
directory (assuming Vim 7.2). In that case you do not need to download any 
extra packages. Instead, you simply need to clear `diffexpr` so that the 
broken `MyDiff()` function is not used. After restarting Vim, use command 
`:echo $PATH` to check your PATH. You should see that the directory holding 
`gvim.exe`, `vim.exe` and `diff.exe` has been added to the PATH. Therefore 
(assuming you have no other diff programs), Vim should correctly invoke the 
`diff.exe` provided with the "Vim without Cream" install, and all diffs should 
work correctly.

If errors prevent diff from running, use the verbose option to see how diff 
is called. For example:

>
    gvim -V -od file1 file2
<

Vim may write temporary files when performing a diff. Therefore, you need 
valid TEMP or TMP environment variables that point to an existing directory 
where you are able to write files. For more information, see the tip on 
handling temp environment errors |vwt-1532|.

DIFF OPTIONS                                            *vwt-416-diff-options*

Some people vertically align variables and comments by adding or removing 
whitespace. However, those trivial changes may clutter the output from diff 
when you later compare the old and new files to check your changes. To ignore 
whitespace in the diff, enter the command:

>
    set diffopt+=iwhite
<

You can issue this command while viewing a diff (you may also need 
`:diffupdate` to update the display), or you can add the command to your vimrc 
so it is always in effect. :help 'diffopt'

VIM DISTRIBUTION FROM CREAM              *vwt-416-vim-distribution-from-cream*

Where to download Vim [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Where_to_download_Vim] 
mentions that Cream's "standard" Vim is a good place to download a fully 
patched installation of Vim and gvim for Windows (using the "Windows Vim 
installers without Cream" choice). However, versions upto 7.2.2 (and possibly 
later) have a bug in the way that diff is installed.

By default, the install creates directory `C:\Program Files\vim` which 
contains only files `README_lang.txt` and `_vimrc`, and folder `vim72` which 
contains the Vim files, including `gvim.exe`, as well as GNU Win32 `diff.exe` 
(of course, the directory is `vim72` for version 7.2, or something different 
for other versions).

The `_vimrc` file has contents:

>
    set nocompatible
    source $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim
    source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim
    behave mswin
    
    set diffexpr=MyDiff()
    function MyDiff()
      let opt = ''
      if &diffopt =~ 'icase' | let opt = opt . '-i ' | endif
      if &diffopt =~ 'iwhite' | let opt = opt . '-b ' | endif
      silent execute '\"!C:\Program Files\vim\diff\" -a ' . opt . v:fname_in . ' ' . v:fname_new . ' > ' . v:fname_out
    endfunction
<

The bug appears when an attempt to use diff is made (in gvim for example, 
with the File menu, "Split Diff with"). The following error occurs:

>
    Error detected while processing function MyDiff:
    line    4:
    E10: \ should be followed by /, ? or &
<

After editing `_vimrc` to fix this error, a second error occurs:

>
    E97: Cannot create diffs
<

As described above |vwt-416-recommended-solution|, the fix is simply to clear 
`diffexpr` so the `MyDiff()` function is not used. However, if you need to use 
the function, you can edit `_vimrc` to change line 4 of `MyDiff` by removing 
the backslash before the double quotes, and by moving the bang (`!`) so it is 
before the quoted path, and by changing the path to the location where 
`diff.exe` occurs. The final correct line 4 is:

>
    silent execute '!"C:\Program Files\vim\vim72\diff" -a ' . opt . v:fname_in . ' ' . v:fname_new . ' > ' . v:fname_out
<

Or even better, to remain compatible when you upgrade Vim, change the line 
to:

>
    silent execute '!"'.$VIMRUNTIME.'\diff" -a ' . opt . v:fname_in . ' ' . v:fname_new . ' > ' . v:fname_out
<

You may find that changing the line as follows works (the first diff found in 
the current directory or directories of the PATH will be used):

>
    silent execute '!diff -a ' . opt . v:fname_in . ' ' . v:fname_new . ' > ' . v:fname_out
<

After this change (and restarting Vim), diff works correctly.

OTHER SOLUTIONS                                      *vwt-416-other-solutions*

If you need to use the `MyDiff()` function, another proposal that worked with 
Vim 6.4 is shown below (it should probably use $VIMRUNTIME as above).

>
    if has('win32')
      set diffexpr=MyDiff()
      function! MyDiff()
        let opt = '-a --binary '
        if &diffopt =~ 'icase' | let opt = opt . '-i ' | endif
        if &diffopt =~ 'iwhite' | let opt = opt . '-b ' | endif
        let arg1 = v:fname_in
        if arg1 =~ ' ' | let arg1 = '"' . arg1 . '"' | endif
        let arg2 = v:fname_new
        if arg2 =~ ' ' | let arg2 = '"' . arg2 . '"' | endif
        let arg3 = v:fname_out
        if arg3 =~ ' ' | let arg3 = '"' . arg3 . '"' | endif
        if &sh =~ '\<cmd'
          silent execute '!""' . $VIM. '\vim64\diff.exe" ' . opt . arg1 . ' ' . arg2 . ' > ' . arg3 . '"'
        else
          silent execute '!'.$VIM.'\vim64\diff.exe" ' . opt . arg1 . ' ' . arg2 . ' > ' . arg3
        endif
      endfunction
    endif
<

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-416-comments*

TO DO
    - Need ideas for a better name for this tip. 
    - Should check the "Recommended solution" which is my understanding of the 
      confusion behind all the misguided comments on the problem. 
    - Perhaps should give a little more prominence to the para on problems with 
      TEMP. 
    - Should expand the section on diff options, and add a short section showing 
      some usage examples (windo diffthis, diffoff! and a little more). 
    - Decide whether the "Other solutions" section is useful. 


==============================================================================

Under cygwin, I found that the backslashes in the path for the "execute" 
command caused trouble. You should be able to fix this by changing each 
backslash to a forward slash, or by changing each backslash with two 
backslashes.

I saw that I needed the fix after removing "silent" from the command so that 
I could see exactly what was executed.

==============================================================================

There's no general solution to fix this problem out-of-the-box. It depends on 
the idiosyncrasies of the command processor (shell) that is used to "silent 
execute" the line. For instance, on my Windows XP I usually start gvim from a 
4nt.exe command line, which in turn sets COMSPEC to be 4nt.exe instead of the 
default cmd.exe. So, in my case, the simplest way to fix MyDiff is to change 
it this way:

>
    silent execute '!C:\Progra~1\vim\vim63\diff -a ' . opt . v:fname_in . ' ' . v:fname_new . ' > ' . v:fname_out
<

==============================================================================

I use Windows 2000 with bash.exe [http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/bash/] and 
UnixUtils [http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/].

I had to add `set shell=bash.exe` to my _vimrc to get it working. Of course 
`bash.exe` must be in the PATH.

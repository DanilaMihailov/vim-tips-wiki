==============================================================================

I just discovered Vim, I really liked 'split' capability, I'm so used to edit 
Python source code on SciTe editor, I really missed the default CTRL-1 to 
check the syntax and F5 to run the script...

So, this is my suggestion, add these lines to your vimrc file:

>
    autocmd BufRead *.py set makeprg=python\ -c\ \"import\ py_compile,sys;\ sys.stderr=sys.stdout;\ py_compile.compile(r'%')\"
    autocmd BufRead *.py set efm=%C\ %.%#,%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\,\ line\ %l%.%#,%Z%[%^\ ]%\\@=%m
    autocmd BufRead *.py nmap <F5> :!python %<CR>
<

Make sure that python is in your path, now when you open any python file just 
type ":make" to get the syntax errors, use ":cnext", to move to next error, 
check the help on make (":help make 
[http://vimplugin.sf.net/cgi-bin/help?tag=make]") for more info on how to 
navigate errors.

As you are checking now, <F5> is mapped to execute the current script. Also I 
suggest you to use add the following lines to vimrc:

>
    autocmd BufRead *.py set tabstop=4
    autocmd BufRead *.py set nowrap
    autocmd BufRead *.py set go+=b
<

That will make to use a 4 spaces for you tabstop (only visually), it avoids 
wrapping your code and will add a bottom scrollbar. Now I like vim a litle bit 
more.

How about having the line:

>
    nmap <buffer> <F5> :w<Esc>mwG:r!python %<CR>`.
<

in the file $VIM/vimfiles/ftplugin/python.vim?

(I have the preceding line with 'python' replaced by 'perl' in the file 
$VIM/vimfiles/ftplugin/perl.vim )

(The adjective <buffer> in the map of <F5> restricts the map to the buffer. 
The map of <F5> as given in the tip is "permanent" in the sense that after 
opening a *.py file, the map remains for other non-*.py files.

Also, putting the map in a ftplugin-file means that it is available even when 
the python file-type is detected by means other than the .py extension -- 
means such as the command ':set ft=python' or the shebang.)

==============================================================================

The counterpart of python's sys.stderr=sys.stdout in perl is the following 
line placed toward the beginning of the perl file:

>
    BEGIN {(*STDERR = *STDOUT) || die;}
<

The preceding is needed so that the 'r' in the map of <F5> can capture stuff 
in stderr.

==============================================================================

Here's a script that automatically checks the syntax while saving and refuses 
to save files with syntax errors. Mildly hacky but it seems to work just fine.

>
    " Define the current compiler
    if exists("compiler")
      finish
    endif
    let compiler = "python"
    
    " Set python as the make program and
    setlocal makeprg=python
    setlocal errorformat=%C\ %.%#,%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\,\ line\ %l%.%#,%Z%[%^\ ]%\\@=%m
    
    " When writing Python file check the syntax
    au! BufWriteCmd *.py call CheckPythonSyntax()
    
    function CheckPythonSyntax()
      " Write the current buffer to a temporary file, check the syntax and
      " if no syntax errors are found, write the file
      let curfile = bufname("%")
      let tmpfile = tempname()
      silent execute "write! ".tmpfile
      let output = system("python -c \"__import__('py_compile').compile(r'".tmpfile."')\" 2>&1")
      if output != ''
        " Make sure the output specifies the correct filename
        let output = substitute(output, fnameescape(tmpfile), fnameescape(curfile), "g")
        echo output
      else
        write
      endif
      " Delete the temporary file when done
      call delete(tmpfile)
    endfunction

==============================================================================

It may be helpful to run a commmand periodically in the background. This can 
be used, for example, to write an auto-updating clock in Vim, or to check for 
user input via an input loop, such as in a game. In one application, Vim was 
used as a front end for a media player, where the song information had to be 
updated and other actions taken when a song finished.

FAKING A TIMER  *vwt-1612-faking-a-timer*

Since there is no timer function in Vim < version 8, a trick is needed: the 
CursorHold autocommand that re-triggers itself. In the following, feedkeys() 
function is used with specially crafted key sequence that has no effect except 
re-triggering the autoevent. The period depends on the value of updatetime 
option (also known as ut). The value of updatetime option is in milliseconds. 
Do not set the value too low.

    autocmd CursorHold * call Timer()
    function! Timer()
      call feedkeys("f\e")

COMMENTS  *vwt-1612-comments*
    -  The trick with K_IGNORE does not work anymore after version 7.2.025 (Oct-2008). You need to use different sequence of keys.

    -  How about if Vim is in Insert mode for a while?
    -  In Insert mode, you can harness  |CursorHoldI| and  |CursorMovedI| in addition to  |CursorHold| and  |CursorMoved|; but the risk of interference remains with other uses of these events, or with the original use of 'updatetime' to write the swap file.

    -  vim 8 has 'real' timer support.No need to fake timer.

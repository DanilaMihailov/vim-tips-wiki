==============================================================================

If you modify the text using some script, and then undo it, the cursor may 
not return to the place where it was before the script was run (called). This 
comes from the fact that when Vim performs an undo, it restores the position 
to where the change happened, and not where the cursor was before the change. 
For example:

>
    :3
    :6,7d
    u
<

The cursor will be on line 6, not line 3.

Say you have a function `func()` that changes the text. Cursor is somewhere 
before the calling. You can insert

>
    normal ix
    normal x
<

in the beginning of the function/script (before other changes). Then when the 
script returns, an undo will restore the cursor position to the place right 
before `func()` is called. With the above two lines before any other changes 
to be made by the function, the following effect is achieved:

>
    " cursor is now at linenr, colnr
    :call func()
    u
    " cursor is now restored at linenr, colnr
<

Without the "fake" change, undo will go to a position closest to where the 
first change is made by the function/script, not where the cursor was when the 
function is called.

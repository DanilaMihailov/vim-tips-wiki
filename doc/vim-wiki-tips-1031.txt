==============================================================================

If you would like to embed Vim inside your Java application I found, that 
best way how to do it, is Java terminal emulation. Download jta26.jar from 
http://javassh.org/space/start [http://javassh.org/space/start]. Then start 
Vim from your Java program and redirect stdin and stdout to and from terminal 
emulator.

For some unknown reason you have to use Vim without GUI support, that is, GUI 
support isn't compiled into binary. You have to use pure terminal Vim.

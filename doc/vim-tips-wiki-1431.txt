==============================================================================

This tip is inspired by the Eclipse task list feature, which automagically 
populates tasks when you put comments in Java code with a prefix of "TODO".

The idea is to create a tag for each TODO entry and then create a Vim command 
to list only those tags. The example will be for Java, but you'll see that it 
should work for any language.

Assuming you use ctags to generate your tags file, add the following to 
~/.ctags:

>
    --regex-java=/\/\/TODO(.*)/todo\1/
<

This will cause ctags to create tags for the following code:

>
    //TODO djh fix this horrible hack
    //TODO djh comment this
<

with names:

>
    todo djh fix this horrible hack
    todo djh comment this
<

You can then add the following to vimrc to create a command that easily lists 
these.

>
    command TODO tselect /^todo djh
<

Note that I'm only interested in TODOs that begin with my initials - you may 
want to simply use /^todo. Be careful though! If you have case-insensitivity 
turned on, you may get false positives for tags of the form 'toDouble'. This 
can be fixed by changing your todos to //TODO:

==============================================================================

Vim's help is remarkably helpful, but in order to use it effectively you need 
to spend a few minutes learning how it is organised.

GETTING STARTED                                      *vwt-882-getting-started*

Try these examples:
    - Enter `:help` to browse help. Scroll down the help page to see the quickref 
      and tutor links, and the table of contents. 
    - Enter :help |pattern| for help on the topic pattern (for example). 
    - `:h pattern` is the same (the `:help` command can be abbreviated). 


Command completion can be used when entering a help topic:
    - Type `:h patt` then press Ctrl-D to list all topics that contain "`patt`". 
    - Type `:h patt` then press Tab to scroll through the topics that start with 
      "`patt`". 
    - If you have set the 'wildmenu' option (e.g. by using `:set wildmenu`), then 
      `:h patt` followed by <Tab> opens a menu on the statusline, with all help 
      topics containing "`patt`". You can select any item in the menu with the arrow 
      keys or more presses of the <Tab> key to fill in the rest of your command 
      line. 


Links:
    - Enter `:h` to open the main help page. 
    - Type `/quick` to search for "quick" (should find the `quickref` link). 
    - Press Ctrl-] to follow the link (jump to the quickref topic). 
    - After browsing the quickref topic, press Ctrl-T to go back to the previous 
      topic. 
    - You can also press Ctrl-O to jump to older locations, or Ctrl-I to jump to 
      newer locations. 


Searching:
    - Search within a help file using `/` like you would when searching any file. 
    - Search all the help files with the `:helpgrep` command, for example: 


:helpgrep \csearch.\{,12}file
\c means the pattern is case insensitive.
The pattern finds "search" then up to 12 characters followed by "file".

You will then see the first match. To see other matches for the same pattern, use:
:cnext
:cprev
:cnfile
:cpfile
:cfirst
:clast

and even
:cc

which brings you back to the current match after you scrolled the helpfile, or
:copen

which will list out all the matches in a separate window. Read up on these commands with the :help entry for each of them!

Each week (or more often if you prefer), read a new section from the `:help` 
page to learn something new!

CONTEXT                                                      *vwt-882-context*

Each help topic has a context:

Sometimes you want to know what a particular control key means to Vim. For 
example, to see all help topics containing "ctrl-r", type `:h ctrl-r` then 
press Ctrl-D. The following examples show the help for pressing various keys 
in different contexts.

SIMPLIFY HELP NAVIGATION                    *vwt-882-simplify-help-navigation*

The following mappings simplify navigation when viewing help:
    - Press Enter to jump to the subject (topic) under the cursor. 
    - Press Backspace to return from the last jump. 
    - Press `s` to find the next subject, or `S` to find the previous subject. 
    - Press `o` to find the next option, or `O` to find the previous option. 


Create file `~/.vim/ftplugin/help.vim` (Unix) or 
`$HOME/vimfiles/ftplugin/help.vim` (Windows) containing:

>
    nnoremap <buffer> <CR> <C-]>
    nnoremap <buffer> <BS> <C-T>
    nnoremap <buffer> o /'\l\{2,\}'<CR>
    nnoremap <buffer> O ?'\l\{2,\}'<CR>
    nnoremap <buffer> s /\|\zs\S\+\ze\|<CR>
    nnoremap <buffer> S ?\|\zs\S\+\ze\|<CR>
<

The following mappings (which can go in your vimrc) simplify navigating the 
results of |quickfix| commands such as (among others) `:helpgrep`

>
    :nnoremap <S-F1>  :cc<CR>
    :nnoremap <F2>    :cnext<CR>
    :nnoremap <S-F2>  :cprev<CR>
    :nnoremap <F3>    :cnfile<CR>
    :nnoremap <S-F3>  :cpfile<CR>
    :nnoremap <F4>    :cfirst<CR>
    :nnoremap <S-F4>  :clast<CR>
<

Also see the wildmenu. My settings:

>
    set wildmenu wildmode=longest:full,full
<

What it does:
    - First tab: longest match, list in the statusbar. 
    - Following tabs: cycle through matches.

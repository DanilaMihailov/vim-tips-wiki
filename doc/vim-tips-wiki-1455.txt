==============================================================================

When you want to jump to a definition of a variable, what do you do? Use 
`C-]` or `gd`?

`C-]` finds only global variables (and functions; ctags extracts only global 
objects).

On the other hand, `gd` detects only local variables.

I think it's a bit complicated to choose between them. So I wrote this 
function:

>
    function! GoDefinition()
      let l:pos = getpos('.')
      normal! gd
      if getpos('.') == l:pos
        execute 'tag' expand('<cword>')
      endif
    endfunction
    nnoremap <C-]> :<C-U>call GoDefinition()<CR>
<

This function first does `gd` to try to find a local definition of a variable 
under the cursor, and if it failed then probably the variable is a global 
variable, so it tries `:tag`.

This way, you can jump to the definition of both local and global variables 
with the same key.

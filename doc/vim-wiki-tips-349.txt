==============================================================================

If you open an xml document that is either totally or partially unindented, 
you can use the GNU libxml2 libary's xmllint to reformat and align your 
document. This is especially good if you want to save your xml documents using 
as little space as possible (which would be totally unindented). Just add this 
under the autocmd section of your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    au FileType xml exe ":silent %!xmllint --format --recover - 2>/dev/null"
<

This instructs vim to take the entire contents of a *.xml file and pass it 
through xmllint, using the --format and --recover flags and silencing any 
errors that may occur. This is generally a very effective process and will 
only mess up on very poorly typed (a large amount of incorrect syntax) xml 
documents. Please note that xmllint only adds and removes structural space. It 
does not remove space from regular text nodes (as doing so would be 
incorrect).

XMLLINT AS A MAP                                    *vwt-349-xmllint-as-a-map*

If you don't want the XML file to be automatically formatted as soon as you 
edit it, you can create a map by putting the following command in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    map @@x !%xmllint --format --recover -^M
<

When you are in command mode and press @@x, Vim will run all of the lines in 
the current file through the xmllint command.

XMLLINT AS A FILTER                              *vwt-349-xmllint-as-a-filter*

Q: How can make it as a filter?

I tried sth like

>
    let&l:equalprg='xmllint --format --recover'
<

but it didn't work since xmllint doesn't take STDIN?

A: Notice the '-' given as the file argument to xmllint. This usually means 
stdin. So, the full command should be:

>
    let &l:equalprg='xmllint --format --recover -'
<

A: Yes, xmllint can read from stdin, please note the '-' that occurs at the 
end of the options. This tells it to dump the file contents to the stdin pipe 
for xmllint. As far as I know, xmllint can be run in windows if you have gcc, 
but I am just projecting...look into it. If not, I am sure you can find 
something to take its place...the tip is just that, a tip, build on it.

A: Regarding the filter question:

Start playing with

>
    " one or more lines:
    vmap ,px !xmllint --format -<CR>
    " pretty-print current line
    nmap ,px !!xmllint --format -<CR>
<

FIXING INDENTING OF COMMENT LINES  *vwt-349-fixing-indenting-of-comment-lines*

"xmllint --format" indents comment lines to 0 which screws up the formatting 
for vim. A simple fix for single line comments can be made in indent/xml.vim. 
Copy indent/xml.vim to ~/.vim/xml.vim (Unix systems) and change the line that 
says:

>
    let lnum = prevnonblank(a:lnum - 1)
<

To this:

>
    let lnum = a:lnum
    while lnum > 0
        let lnum = prevnonblank(lnum - 1)
        let line = getline(lnum)
        if line =~ '-->'
            let [lnum,watever] = searchpos('<!--','b')
        else
            break
        endif
    endwhile
<

Alone-on-line end-of-comment closing-tags may get badly indented though.

XMLLINT ON WINDOWS                                *vwt-349-xmllint-on-windows*

Download xmllint for Windows 
[http://code.google.com/p/xmllint/downloads/list]Use the following command, 
assuming xml file is open in Vim and xmllint.exe is in the same directory as 
the file:

>
    :% !xmllint.exe "%" --format
<

The first % ensures the content of the open file is replaced with the results 
of passing through xmllint. The order of the second % and the flag --format is 
important as otherwise xmllint will try to open a file with the name 
"--format". The quotes around the second % allow file paths that include 
spaces to be passed to xmllint.

ALTERNATIVES TO XMLLINT                      *vwt-349-alternatives-to-xmllint*

Seriously consider using Vim's built-in search and replace functionality. See 
this Pretty-formatting_XML [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Pretty-formatting_XML] 
and the third comment (:%s/></>\r</g , etc).

I was dissatisfied with what xmllint was doing to my XML documents. Its 
--format option seems to arbitrarily expand or remove blank lines. An 
alternative is to use the tidy program - formerly HTML Tidy. available at 
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ [http://tidy.sourceforge.net/] I altered my 
.vimrc as follows:

>
    au FileType xml exe ":silent 1,$!tidy --input-xml true --indent yes 2>/dev/null"
<

Here's how you use tidy with xml on Windows:

>
    au FileType xml exe ":silent 1,$!tidy -q -i -xml"
<

I have this in my .vimrc

>
    " select xml text to format and hit ,x
    vmap ,x :!tidy -q -i -xml<CR>
<

UTF-8 FORMAT                                            *vwt-349-utf-8-format*

Q: One problem with "xmllint --format" is that it turns non-ASCII UTF-8 
characters into numeric references. This isn't a problem if you're taking the 
input of xmllint and editing it with an XML editor that internally converts 
everything to UTF-8 (like XMetal), but if what you want to do is use Vim to 
edit the file as a native UTF-8 (with :set encoding=utf8), then you *don't* 
want a bunch of numeric references instead of Unicode.

The xmllint developer knows about this issue but feels that adding an option 
to keep/not keep UTF-8 would complicate the code too much. So... is there 
another XML reformatter more suitable for producing output that Vim can use?

A: Try http://www.pinkjuice.com/howto/vimxml/tasks.xml#prettyprinting 
[http://www.pinkjuice.com/howto/vimxml/tasks.xml#prettyprinting]

A: I will change the solution described at the above URL since there is a 
very simple solution to the problem:

CHANGING TAB/IDENT WIDTH                    *vwt-349-changing-tab/ident-width*

Q:. Any ideas on how to use xmllint, but change the tab/indent width? It 
seems to filter, on windows, with 2 spaces for a tab.

A:. In Unix/Linux, if you don't like the default indentation (2 spaces), set 
the $XMLLINT_INDENT environment variable, or prefix the xmllint command in 
your .vimrc file:

>
    au FileType xml exe ":silent 1,$!XMLLINT_INDENT='    ' xmllint --format --recover - 2>/dev/null"
<

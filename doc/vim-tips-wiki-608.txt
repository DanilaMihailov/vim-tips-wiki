==============================================================================

The Python language is generally more powerful than Vim's scripting language. 
If you want to evaluate a fragment of Python code in Vim, you can use command:

>
    :py print 2*2
<

See :help |if_pyth.txt|.

Below is a more elaborate example. Put the following code in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    python << EOL
    import vim
    # Do not say 'from vim import *' because that
    # will delete builtin function eval.
    
    def EvaluateCurrentLine(*args):
      cur_str = vim.current.line
      action, symb = None, None
      for i in args:
        if i in ["r","p"]: action = i
        else: symb = i
      try: start = cur_str.rindex(symb)+len(symb)
      except: start = 0
      result = eval(cur_str[start:],globals())
      if action == "r":
        vim.current.line = cur_str[:start]+str(result)
      else:
        print result
    EOL
    command -narg=* PyEv python EvaluateCurrentLine(<f-args>)
<

Be careful about identation in the Python part. This code provides command:

>
    :PyEv
<

This command evaluates expression in line under cursor and prints result in 
echo area.

With r argument, it will evaluate the expression and be replaced by the 
result of evaluation:

>
    :PyEv r
<

You can give one more argument - it will mark from which char in current line 
it should start evaluation.

For example:Running the following command:

>
    :PyEv r {
<

on the following line:

>
    \setlength{\textwidth}{450-63
<

will give:

>
    \setlength{\textwidth}{387
<

I tried to modify your script to execute a range of lines, but the :command's 
-range option did not seem to propagate into vim.current.range.It always just 
took one line instead of the range I specified. I finally ended up with:

>
    python << EOL
    import vim
    def EvaluateCurrentRange():
      eval(compile('\n'.join(vim.current.range),'<string>','exec'),globals())
    EOL
    map H :py EvaluateCurrentRange()<CR>
<

The command definition using the same function (command -range Pyr python 
EvaluateCurrentRange()) did not work.

==============================================================================

This tip shows how to search using Vim, including use of * (the super star) 
to search for the current word. Search options are described, and the see also 
|vwt-679-see-also| section links to other useful searching tips.

BASIC SEARCHING                                      *vwt-679-basic-searching*

In normal mode you can search forwards by pressing / (or <kDivide>) then 
typing your search pattern. Press Esc to cancel or press Enter to perform the 
search. Then press n to search forwards for the next occurrence, or N to 
search backwards. Type ggn to jump to the first match, or GN to jump to the 
last.

Note: ggn skips first match if it is at row 1 column 1. Type Gn to jump to 
the real first match. For this, 'wrapscan' must be on (default).

Search backwards by pressing ? then typing your search pattern. Pressing n 
searches in the same direction (backwards), while N searches in the opposite 
direction (forwards).

SEARCHING FOR THE CURRENT WORD        *vwt-679-searching-for-the-current-word*

In normal mode, move the cursor to any word. Press * to search forwards for 
the next occurrence of that word, or press # to search backwards.

Using * (also <kMultiply>, <S-LeftMouse>) or # (also <S-RightMouse>) searches 
for the exact word at the cursor (searching for rain would not find rainbow).

Use g* or g# if you don't want to search for the exact word.

USING THE MOUSE                                      *vwt-679-using-the-mouse*

With appropriate settings, you can search for an exact word using the mouse: 
Shift-LeftClick a word to search forwards, or Shift-RightClick to search 
backwards.

This needs a GUI version of Vim (gvim), or a console Vim that accepts a 
mouse. You may need the following line in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] to enable mouse searches:

>
    :set mousemodel=extend
<

In gvim, click the Edit menu, then Global Settings, then the "tear off" bar 
at the top. That will show a floating Global Settings menu with useful Toggle 
Pattern Highlight and Toggle Ignore-case commands.

MORE SEARCHING                                        *vwt-679-more-searching*

Vim maintains a search history |vwt-45|. Type / or ? and use the arrow 
up/down keys to recall previous search patterns. You can edit a pattern, and 
press Enter to search for something different.

Suppose the cursor is on a word, and you want to search for a similar word.

Press / then Ctrl-r then Ctrl-w to copy the current word to the command line. 
You can now edit the search pattern and press Enter. Use Ctrl-r Ctrl-w for a 
<cword>, or Ctrl-r Ctrl-a for a <cWORD>.

After searching, press Ctrl-o to jump back |vwt-10| to your previous position 
(then Ctrl-i will jump forwards).

After searching, an empty search pattern will repeat the last search. This 
works with /, :s and :g.

So, after searching for a word, use :%s//new/g to change all occurrences to 
'new', or :g/ to list all lines containing the word. See substitute last 
search |vwt-1501|.

You can enter a count before a search. For example 3/pattern will search for 
the third occurrence of pattern, and 3* will search for the third occurrence 
of the current word.

You can highlight all search matches (and quickly turn highlighting off), and 
you can use a mapping to highlight all occurrences of the current word without 
moving (see highlight matches |vwt-14|).

A search can include an offset to position the cursor. For example, searching 
with /green positions the cursor at the beginning of the next "green", while 
/green/e positions the cursor at the end of the next "green". :help 
|search-offset|

A search pattern can include characters with codes specified in decimal or 
hex. For example, searching with /\%d65 or with /\%x41 both find 'A' 
(character decimal 65 = hex 41), and searching with /\%d8211 or with /\%u2013 
both find '–' (a Unicode en dash). :help |/\%d|

CASE SENSITIVITY                                    *vwt-679-case-sensitivity*

By default, searching is case sensitive (searching for "the" will not find 
"The").

With the following in your vimrc (or entered via a toggle mapping |vwt-920|), 
searching is not case sensitive:

>
    :set ignorecase
<

Now the command /the will find "the" or "The" or "THE" etc. You can use \c to 
force a pattern to be case insensitive, or \C to force a pattern to be case 
sensitive. For example, the search /the\c is always case insensitive, and 
/the\C is always case sensitive, regardless of the 'ignorecase' option.

If 'ignorecase' is on, you may also want:

>
    :set smartcase
<

When 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' are both on, if a pattern contains an 
uppercase letter, it is case sensitive, otherwise, it is not. For example, 
/The would find only "The", while /the would find "the" or "The" etc.

The 'smartcase' option only applies to search patterns that you type; it does 
not apply to * or # or gd. If you press * to search for a word, you can make 
'smartcase' apply by pressing / then up arrow then Enter (to repeat the search 
from history).

When programming, there is generally no reason to want 'smartcase' to apply 
when you press *. For other situations, use:

>
    :nnoremap * /\<<C-R>=expand('<cword>')<CR>\><CR>
    :nnoremap # ?\<<C-R>=expand('<cword>')<CR>\><CR>
<

With these mappings, if 'smartcase' is on and you press * while on the word 
"The", you will only find "The" (case sensitive), but if you press * while on 
the word "the", the search will not be case sensitive.

The mapping for * uses / to start a search; the pattern begins with \< and 
ends with \> so only whole words are found; <C-R>= inserts the expression 
register to evaluate expand('<cword>') which inserts the current word (similar 
to Ctrl-R Ctrl-W but avoiding an error when used on a blank line).

SHOW THE NEXT MATCH WHILE ENTERING A SEARCH *vwt-679-show-the-next-match-while-entering-a-search*

To move the cursor to the matched string, while typing the search pattern, 
set the following option in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    :set incsearch
<

Complete the search by pressing Enter, or cancel by pressing Esc. When typing 
the search pattern, press Ctrl-L (:help |c_CTRL-L|) to insert the next 
character from the match or press Ctrl-R Ctrl-W (:help |c_CTRL-R_CTRL-F|) to 
complete the current matching word.

OTHER SEARCH OPTIONS                            *vwt-679-other-search-options*

By default, the 'wrapscan' option is on, which means that when "search next" 
reaches end of file, it wraps around to the beginning, and when "search 
previous" reaches the beginning, it wraps around to the end.

These examples show how to set 'wrapscan' (abbreviated as 'ws'):

>
    :set nowrapscan        " do not wrap around
    :set wrapscan          " wrap around
    :set wrapscan!         " toggle wrap around on/off
    :set ws! ws?           " toggle and show value
<

By default, search hits may occur in lines at the top or bottom of the 
window. The 'scrolloff' option 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Make_search_results_appear_in_the_middle_of_the_screen] 
controls whether context lines will be visible above and below the line 
containing the search hit.

If your text is folded, you probably want folds to automatically open to 
reveal search hits. To achieve that, the 'foldopen' option should include 
"search" (check by entering :set fdo?). :help 'foldopen' Conversely, this 
option can be used to Search only in unfolded text 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_only_in_unfolded_text].

backwards.

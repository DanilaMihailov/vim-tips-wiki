==============================================================================

Usually, when opening an editfile while 'encoding' is set to UTF-8, Vim will 
try UTF-8 before Latin1. This is all good and proper since the UTF-8 heuristic 
can give an error result and the Latin1 one cannot. However, if the file 
contains (at the moment) only 7-bit ASCII data, it will be represented 
identically under Latin1 and UTF-8, and no one (not even a human) can decide 
without additional information.

If we want later-added bytes above 127 to be represented as Unicode, the 
solution is simple: we can add a BOM to the file by setting the 'bomb' option 
(":setlocal bomb"). But what if we want later data between 128 and 255 to be 
represented as Latin1? This is a little trickier, but the answer is simple; 
it's of the kind that makes one say "Now why didn't I think of that?". Here it 
is:
    - If you want your file to be always interpreted by Vim as Latin1 and never as 
      UTF-8, place in it a line with a number of "upper-ASCII" bytes in it (i.e. 
      bytes in the range 128-255), then save the file after making sure that 
      'fileencoding' is set to Latin1, e.g. by doing ":setlocal fenc=latin1". In a 
      program source file or a shell script, the line can be a comment; in a text 
      file, it can be "fancy underlining". The following will do (for example): > # 
      zim: set fenc=latin1 nomod : ÷÷÷÷÷÷ < 


Place it where you would a modeline. Notice that with the letter v instead of 
z in column 3 it would be a modeline; but the problem with setting the 
'fileencoding' by means of a modeline is that the latter's action happens only 
after the file has been read. This line will make the "typical" 
'fileencodings' heuristics (as set, e.g., by ":set 
fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,latin1") to give a "negative" result for UTF-8, so 
that Vim's automatic mechanisms will recognise the file as Latin1.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1288-comments*

If the purpose is to ensure the loader fails to match it UTF-8, why not just 
put something like #£ in the file. Why bother with the pseudo-modeline?

You could. One possible way is to use Latin1 "divide-by signs" to underline the top title. It all depends what you want the file to look like. You may also want to make sure that none of your co-editors (if any) remove the upper-ASCII bytes, and that may require a comment. -- Tonymec 15:48, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

==============================================================================

To force opening a file in Latin1 I just call vim this way:

>
    $ vim --cmd "set encoding=Latin1" file.txt
<

This is a bad idea, it sets Vim's internal encoding to Latin1. Most people 
using a Vim with encoding utf-8 are doing so intentionally and would not want 
Vim to internally use Latin1. You will then be unable to view any characters 
not in Latin1 inside Vim.

The correct way to do this from the command-line, if you know in advance that 
the file is Latin1, is something like this:

>
    $ vim -c "e ++enc=latin1" file.txt
<

However, the entire point of this tip, is that one does not NEED to remember 
to specify on the command-line whenever editing a pure latin1 file.

A good way to search and replace the word under the cursor is shown here 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace#substitute_last_search]. This 
tip simplifies such operations.

MANUAL PROCEDURE                                    *vwt-464-manual-procedure*

If you only have a few occurrences to change, you might prefer a manual 
technique which does not require a mapping. If all foo words need to be 
changed to bar:
    - Put the cursor on foo. 
    - Press * to search for the next occurrence. 
    - Type ciw (change inner word) then bar then press Escape. 
    - Press n (move to next occurrence) then . (repeat change 
      [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Repeat_last_change]). 
    - Repeat last step. 


MAPPING                                                      *vwt-464-mapping*

With this mapping in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], you can 
easily enter a command to substitute all occurrences of the word under the 
cursor:

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>s :%s/\<<C-r><C-w>\>/
<

Given this mapping, if the cursor is on the word foo and you press \s 
(assuming the default backslash Leader key), you will see:

>
    :%s/\<foo\>/
<

If you now type bar/g and press Enter, you will change all foo to bar. The \< 
and \> ensure that only complete words are found (the search finds foo but not 
food).

Alternatively, you could use this mapping so that the final /g is already 
entered:

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>s :%s/\<<C-r><C-w>\>//g<Left><Left>
<

SIMILAR CHANGES                                      *vwt-464-similar-changes*

Sometimes similar changes to several words are needed. For example, you might 
need < before each word, and > after (this specific example is probably best 
handled with the surround plugin 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697], and is used here just 
as an illustration). One approach would be to record a macro 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros] that performs the operations required. 
The following alternative uses substitute commands.

If you know in advance what needs to be changed, you could use a suitable 
pattern. For example, the following changes all red and all blue words:

>
    :%s/\<\(<red>\|<blue>\)\>/<&>/g
<

The replacement is <&> where & has a special meaning: it is replaced by the 
search match.

The following mapping evaluates an expression to replace all occurrences of 
the word that is currently under the cursor. Move the cursor to a word, then 
press F8 to change all occurrences of that word. Then move to another word and 
press F8 again.

>
    :nnoremap <expr> <F8> ':%s/\<'.expand('<cword>').'\>/<&>/g<CR>'
<

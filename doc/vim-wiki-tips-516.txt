==============================================================================

When searching in Vim, you enter a search pattern. This tip provides a 
tutorial introduction to using search patterns.

FINDING A WHOLE WORD  *vwt-516-finding-a-whole-word*

In a program, you may want to search for an identifier named i. However, 
entering the search /i will find every hit, including the "i" in words like 
"if" and "while". In a pattern, \< represents the beginning of a word, and \> 
represents the end of a word, so to find only the whole word "i", use the 
pattern:

>
    \<i\>
<

In normal mode, press / to start a search, then type the pattern (\<i\>), 
then press Enter.

If you have an example of the word you want to find on screen, you do not 
need to enter a search pattern. Simply move the cursor anywhere within the 
word, then press * to search for the next occurrence of that whole word. Vim 
inserts \< and \> automatically (see searching |vwt-1|).

The pattern \<i finds all words that start with "i", while i\> finds all 
words that end with "i".

FINDING DUPLICATE WORDS  *vwt-516-finding-duplicate-words*

Sometimes words are accidentally duplicated in text (like this this). The 
following pattern finds repeated words that are separated by whitespace 
(spaces, tabs, or newlines):

>
    \(\<\w\+\>\)\_s*\<\1\>
<

The pattern searches for \<\w\+\> (word beginning \<, word character \w, one 
or more \+ word characters, word end \>). That is, it searches for a whole 
word. It then looks for any amount of whitespace (\_s*); \s matches space or 
tab, while \_s matches space or tab or newline (end-of-line character). 
Finally, the pattern looks for \1 which is the whole word that was found in 
the escaped parentheses.

FINDING THIS OR THAT  *vwt-516-finding-this-or-that*

A search pattern can use \| to search for something or something else. For 
example, to search for all occurrences of "red" or "green" or "blue", enter 
the following search pattern (in normal mode, press / then type the pattern, 
then press Enter):

>
    red\|green\|blue
<

To replace all instances of "red" or "green" or "blue" with "purple", enter:

>
    :%s/red\|green\|blue/purple/g
<

However, the above pattern finds "red" in "bored", so the substitute would 
change "bored" to "bopurple". If that is not what you want, use the following 
pattern to find only the whole words "red" or "green" or "blue":

>
    \<\(red\|green\|blue\)\>
<

In a pattern, \< and \> respectively specify the beginning and end of a word, 
while \( and \) respectively specify the beginning and end of a group (the 
pattern \<red\|green\|blue\>, without escaped parentheses, would find "red" 
occurring at the beginning of a word, or "green" occurring anywhere, or "blue" 
occurring at the end of a word).

After searching with the command /\<\(red\|green\|blue\)\> you could change 
the whole words "red" or "green" or "blue" to "purple" by entering the 
following (the search pattern is empty in this command, so it uses the last 
search):

>
    :%s//purple/g
<

In a substitute, you can use & in the replacement to mean the "whole matched 
pattern" (everything that was found). For example, the following will insert 
quotes around all occurrences of the whole words "red" and "green" and "blue":

>
    :%s/\<\(red\|green\|blue\)\>/"&"/g
<

If you do not want the whole matched pattern, you can use parentheses to 
group text in the search pattern, and use the replacement variable \1 to 
specify the first group. For example, the following finds "color x" and 
replaces it with "colored x" where x is the whole word "red" or "green" or 
"blue":

>
    :%s/color \<\(red\|green\|blue\)\>/colored \1/g
<

FINDING TWO WORDS IN EITHER ORDER  *vwt-516-finding-two-words-in-either-order*

You can search for a line that contains two words, in any order. For example, 
the following pattern finds all lines that contain both "red" and "blue", in 
any order:

>
    .*red\&.*blue
<

In a pattern, \& separates alternates, each of which has to match at the same 
position. The two alternates in this example are:
    - .*red (will match all characters from the beginning of a line to the end of the last "red"); and
    - .*blue (will match all characters from the beginning of a line to the end of the last "blue").


A line which contains both "red" and "blue" will match both alternates, 
starting at the beginning of the line. The pattern .*red\&.*blue finds the 
last alternate (but only if all alternates match at the same position), so if 
you are highlighting matches |vwt-14|, you will see text matched by .*blue 
highlighted.

An alternative procedure is to use a pattern that explicitly finds "red" 
followed by "blue", or "blue" followed by "red":

>
    \(red.*blue\)\|\(blue.*red\)
<

To search for lines that contain only the whole words "red" and "blue", in 
either order, use one of the following patterns:

>
    .*\<red\>\&.*\<blue\>
    \(\<red\>.*\<blue\>\)\|\(\<blue\>.*\<red\>\)
<

FINDING TRAILING ZEROES  *vwt-516-finding-trailing-zeroes*

The following pattern finds redundant trailing zeroes in numbers:

>
    \(\.\d\+\)\@<=0\+\>
<

The pattern does not find the "0" in "1.0", but it finds the trailing "00" in 
each of the following numbers: 1.000 1.000200 1.0002000300. After searching, 
the command :%s///g would delete all the redundant zeroes (the search pattern 
is empty, so it uses the last search).

The pattern:
    - Contains \@<= which checks if the preceding atom matches just before what follows.
    - First searches for 0\+\> (what follows).
    - Then checks if what is just before matches \(\.\d\+\) (preceding atom).


The first search is 0\+\> which finds one or more (\+) of 0 followed by end 
of word (\>).

The check is \(\.\d\+\)\@<=0\+\> which verifies that the text immediately 
before the trailing zeroes consists of a decimal point (\.), then one or more 
decimal digits (\d\+). The escaped parentheses \(...\) make an "atom" from 
what is enclosed by the parentheses.

COMMENTS  *vwt-516-comments*

TO DO "finding two words appearing together" as a subtopic will make it 
easier to reach this url through google. It has tips really very useful but 
rarely discussed else where.
    - Mention :h /... for help on a search topic.
    - Should link to a discussion on what "word" means (:help 'iskeyword' simplified), perhaps mentioning \k and \w (and confess that "Finding a whole word" is really "Finding a whole identifier").


I'm a little worried about this tip. I like it best when Vim tips have a 
narrow focus. It's ok to try to cover one topic completely, but I don't like 
tips like Best Vim Tips [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Best_Vim_Tips] that try 
to tell you everything about everything. This one is already a bit 
overwhelming because it tries to cover several completely different, unrelated 
regex items, and there is no clear topic here to prevent it from growing 
without bound. There is no reason to put every regex tip here, and doing so 
will make the information harder to find in my opinion. I'm more likely to 
read small nuggets like "find two words in any order" rather than a generic 
"search patterns" tip that tries to cover everything in :help |pattern.txt|. I 
think if we find ourselves making a "collection" tip, in general we should 
instead make a category to hold several tips. --Fritzophrenic

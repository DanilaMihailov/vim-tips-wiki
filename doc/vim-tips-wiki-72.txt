==============================================================================

Use either of the following commands to delete all empty lines:

>
    :g/^$/d
    :v/./d
<

If you want to delete all lines that are empty or that contain only 
whitespace characters (spaces, tabs), use either of:

>
    :g/^\s*$/d
    :v/\S/d
<

In the second command, `v` operates on lines that do not match, and `\S` 
matches anything that is not a whitespace, and `d` deletes the flagged lines 
(all lines that have no characters, or that have only whitespace characters).

You may want to condense multiple blank lines into a single blank line. The 
following will delete all trailing whitespace |vtw-878| from each line, then 
replace three or more consecutive line endings with two line endings (a single 
blank line):

>
    :%s/\s\+$//e
    :%s/\n\{3,}/\r\r/e
<

The `e` substitute flag means that no error is displayed if the pattern is 
not found. In the second command, `\n` in the search pattern finds newline, 
while `\r` in the replacement inserts a newline.

Another solution is to join consecutive lines found between non-blank lines.

    :v/\S/,/\S/-j

HANDLING IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE                 *vtw-72-handling-ideographic-space*

In CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), the Unicode character 
IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE may be used. If you have 'encoding' utf-8 (and do not have 
the 'l' flag in 'cpoptions'), you can use `\u3000` in a search pattern to 
specify the UTF-16 hex code for IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE. :help |/\]|

In that case, the following will delete all empty lines, or lines that 
contain only combinations of space, tab or IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE.

>
    :g/^[ \t\u3000]*$/d
<

An alternative procedure, which should work in other encodings, would be to 
enter the CJK space directly into the pattern. That is, you would type the 
following, but instead of '#' you would enter a CJK space.

>
    :g/^[ \t#]*$/d
<

If you're not sure how to type the character, position your cursor on an 
example of the character that you already have in the buffer. Then type `yl` 
to yank the character. Then, enter the above `:g` command, but instead of '#' 
type Ctrl-R " (Control-R then double-quote, which will insert the contents of 
the unnamed register containing the yanked character).

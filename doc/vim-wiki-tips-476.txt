as mentioned in the comments, it's better to just use a compiler plugin; 
syntax highlight rules have nothing to do with the compiler and may not be 
loaded anyway

I was fiddling around with the errorformat and makeprg opts, and as I code in 
different languages, i was wondering if there was a way of specifiing a 
special makeprg and errorformat parameter for each language, and there is! 
just edit the $VIM/ftplugin/[syntaxfile].vim

For example, perl.vim, added at the end:

>
    set makeprg=$HOME/bin/vimparse.pl\ -c\ %\ $*
    set errorformat=%f:%l:%m
<

c.vim

>
    set makeprg=g++\ %
<

It works delightfully with the :Make tip VimTip203 |vwt-203|

I mapped F-5 to :Make, and made it go back to the main window:

>
    map <F5> :Make<CR><C-w><Up>
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-476-comments*

I prefer to make a compiler plugin, then use a ftplugin to set a default 
compiler, i.e.:

>
    ~/.vim/compiler/xmllint.vim:
    if exists("current_compiler")
      finish
    endif
    let current_compiler = "xmllint"
    setlocal makeprg=xmllint\ --valid\ --noout\ %
    setlocal errorformat=%f:%l:\ %m
<

>
    ~/.vim/ftplugin/xml.vim
    compiler xmllint
<

This way you can actually set up as many compilers as you want for the same 
filetype. I set a default in my ftplugin, but then a quick ':compiler 
somecompiler' will change to a different one as opposed to having to set 
makeprg and errorformat (remembering those is non-trivial)

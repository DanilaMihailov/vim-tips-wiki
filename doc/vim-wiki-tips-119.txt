I really like the new explorer window, but I wanted it to function a little 
more seemlessly in the editor. The following code does two things. First, the 
explorer is started when Vim is started. I also noticed and fixed that the 
explorers size is not equal to the window size, hence the strange behavior 
when popping between two windows. The other major function of the code is to 
close the explorer when it's the only window that's left. I'd actually like to 
take this a step further and close the window if the last _document_ window is 
closed. I'd prefer that multiple explorers or help windows don't keep the 
application running - only having a file open keeps the application running. 
But I didn't see an easy way to do this... anyone else?

Code (which currently lives in my _vimrc):

>
    " FILE BROWSER STARTUP
    func OpenFileWindow()
      " :runtime plugin/*.vim " this would be useful if you were calling this
      " function from the .vimrc directly
      let g:explDetailedList=1 " show size and date by default
      let g:explVertical=1 " Split vertically
      let g:explStartRight=0 " Put new explorer window to the left of the current window
      :Sexplore
      set nonu
      set winwidth=15 " Make the width of the window match the explorer setting
      "let g:explVertical=0 " Split vertically
      doautocmd fileExplorer BufEnter " Forces the directory refresh to occur
      :winc l " change to the document window
    endfunc
    
    func CloseIfLast()
      if exists("b:completePath") " this is how I determine that I'm in an explorer window
      let n = winnr()
      wincmd p
      if n == winnr()
      quit " quit the window
      endif
      wincmd p
      endif
    endfunc
    
    if has("autocmd")
      if !exists("rudyautocommands")
      let rudyautocommands = 1
      autocmd VimEnter * call OpenFileWindow()
      autocmd WinEnter * call CloseIfLast()
      endif
    endif

This partially works on Vim 7.0. The window is created perfectly (and easier 
than the old version, if you ask me), but it doesn't close when it's the last 
window open.It seems if exists("b:completePath") can no longer be used to 
determine that you're an explorer window.

>
    " FILE BROWSER STARTUP
    func OpenFileWindow()
     :20vs
     :Explore
     wincmd p
    endfunc
    
    func CloseIfLast()
     if exists("b:completePath") " this is how I determine that I'm in an explorer window
     let n = winnr() " pop between windows, if the window number is the same
     wincmd p " then they're the same window.
     if n == winnr()
     quit " quit the window
     endif
     wincmd p
     endif
    endfunc
    
    if has("autocmd")
     if !exists("rudyautocommands")
     let rudyautocommands = 1
     autocmd VimEnter * call OpenFileWindow()
     autocmd WinEnter * call CloseIfLast()
     endif
    endif

Modified to work with both 6.x and 7.0:

>
    " File Browser Setup
    func OpenFileWindow()
     :20vs
     :Explore
     if v:version < 700
     doautocmd fileExplorer BufEnter " Forces the directory refresh to occur
     endif
     wincmd p
    endfunc
    
    func CloseIfLast()
     if v:version >= 700
     if exists("b:netrw_curdir") " Set by netrw file explorer
     let n = winnr() " if window number is the same
     wincmd p
     if n == winnr()
     quit " quit why is this half colored
     endif
     wincmd p
     endif
     elseif v:version >= 600
     if exists("b:completePath") " Set by old (vim6) file explorer
     let n = winnr() " if window number is the same
     wincmd p
     if n == winnr()
     quit " quit why is this half colored
     endif
     wincmd p
     endif
     endif
    endfunc
    
    if has("autocmd")
     if !exists("rudyautocommands")
     let rudyautocommands = 1
    
     autocmd VimEnter * call OpenFileWindow()
     autocmd WinEnter * call CloseIfLast()

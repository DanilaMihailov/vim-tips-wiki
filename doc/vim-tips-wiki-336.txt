==============================================================================

An easy way to to get to a line (whose number we know) faster is to combine 
some existing methods:

>
    :123<CR>
     or
    123G
     or
    123gg
<

The solution is to map the <Enter> key in Normal Mode, to the G command:

>
    :nnoremap <CR> G
<

We can type the line number and then press Enter to get there. Without the 
mapping, 123<Enter> will jump 123 lines down from the current position rather 
than to an absolute number. With the mapping, you can jump very quickly 
especially if you use the numeric keypad. On some systems, to get the numeric 
keypad's Enter key working, you may need to add the following mapping to make 
it do the same as the normal Enter key (or <CR> as in the mapping above):

>
    :nmap <kEnter> <Enter>
<

To launch Vim and start at a certain line, you can pass the line number as 
follows:

>
    vim file.txt +123
<

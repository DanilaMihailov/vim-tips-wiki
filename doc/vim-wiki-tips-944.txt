==============================================================================

Without saving the current buffer you want to send its contents to an 
interpreter (python, scheme, whatever), and you want that interpreter to run 
in a freshly spawned xterm. A new xterm window is useful because running the 
shell within Vim does not allow simultaneously inspection of program output 
and the code buffer, and Vim's shell is weak in several respects.

Put this script in your path and make it executable:

>
    #!/bin/sh
    # This is for use from .vimrc files. It sends vim buffers to the specified
    # interpreter.
    if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]
    then
      echo "ERROR: not enough args."
      echo "VIMRC USAGE: viminterpreter <interpretercommand>"
      exit 1
    fi
    TMP=`mktemp`
    VM="$1" #command to run on the current buffer
    cp /dev/stdin $TMP
    xterm -e "\"$VM\" $TMP && rm $TMP && read"
<

Add the following to vimrc:

>
    map ,p :w !viminterpreter python <CR>
    map ,g :w !viminterpreter gosh <CR>
<

Now you can edit scheme code in an unsaved vim buffer and hit ",g" to see 
what it does. Or ",p" for python code.

COMMENTS  *vwt-944-comments*

Edit the last line in the script to read:

>
    xterm -e "\"$VM\" $TMP; rm $TMP; read"
<

The original doesn't let you see the errors if your script fails.

==============================================================================

Following should help:

>
    :map ,p :!xterm -e "python \"<the_current_buffer>\"" &
<

Note that & at the end of the line.

You can use an expression as the replacement string in the substitute command 
(`:s`). When the replacement string starts with \= it is evaluated as an 
expression. This opens whole new avenue of interesting possiblities. Here are 
a few examples:
    - Number all the lines in a file (insert line number followed by a tab): 


:%s/^/\=line('.')."\t"/
    - Number a range of lines (from line 10 to line 20): 


:10,20s/^/\=line('.')."\t"/
    - Number a range of lines sequentially starting from 1: 


:let counter=0|10,20g//let counter=counter+1|s/^/\=counter."\t"
    - Number all the paragraphs in range starting from 1 (assuming the paragraphs 
      are separated by one or more blank lines): 


:let counter=0|1,20g/^$\n^\s*[^\s]/let counter=counter+1|+1s/^/\=counter."\t"
Note: The above command does not work for the first paragraph in the file if there is no blank line above it.
    - Create a file skeleton with dynamic content 
      [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Use_eval_to_create_dynamic_templates] by using 
      `eval()` in the expression.

You can also substitute inside substitute!

>
    :%s#.*#\='cp '.submatch(0).' all/'.substitute(submatch(0),'/','_','g')#
<

The substitute uses `#` (not a slash) as the delimiter because `/` appears in 
the replacement text. The search pattern (`.*`) is `submatch(0)`.

The replacement expression inserts "`cp `" and "`all/`" and changes any "`/`" 
to "`_`", for example changing line:

>
    sub1/sub2/file1.html
<

to

>
    cp sub1/sub2/file1.html all/sub1_sub2_file1.html
<

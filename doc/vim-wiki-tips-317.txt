==============================================================================

Vim users find the h, j, k, l keys useful for navigating documents without a 
mouse. This tip shows some techniques for configuring vi-like key bindings in 
web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Chromium.

EXTENSIONS  *vwt-317-extensions*

VIMPERATOR  *vwt-317-vimperator*

Vimperator [http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator] is an open source extension 
for Mozilla Firefox inspired by the Vim text editor. It is a feature-rich 
add-on for Firefox and in addition to vi-like key bindings for moving around a 
web page, it has features such as a full ex-mode command line, tab completion, 
and a JavaScript shell. It also allows the user to call up an external editor, 
e.g., GVim to edit text fields in web forms. Note that this extension isn't 
compatible with Firefox >= 57.0 (see here 
[https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs#end-of-life-and-alternatives] 
for a discussion and alternatives)

PENTADACTYL  *vwt-317-pentadactyl*

Pentadactyl [http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/] is an open source 
add-on for Firefox, designed to make browsing more efficient and more keyboard 
accessible. The project is a fork of Vimperator and like it, its appearance 
and user interface should be familiar to Vim users. Additional web-specific 
features such as 'Hint' mode (which allows users to refer to links by labels 
or numbers), command line interface and key bindings to navigate back and 
forward links make it easy to navigate without touching the mouse. It has also 
been designed to be very customisable and makes it easy to write powerful 
scripts.

TRIDACTYL  *vwt-317-tridactyl*

Tridactyl [https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl] aims to re-implement 
Vimperator's feature in a way that is compatible with Firefox >= 57.0

ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF  *vwt-317-issues-to-be-aware-of*

One of the points to note about the above two browser add-ons is that they 
both substantially alter the browser's chrome, i.e. the behaviour and 
appearance of the user interface. Both of the plugins disable and / or remove 
the status bar, toolbars and other visual elements as well as changing 
Firefox's default keyboard short-cuts. Vimperator used to have problems 
working with other Firefox add-ons and custom key bindings set by web 
applications, e.g. GMail. Other add-ons such as those listed below are less 
intrusive and do not modify the browser's appearance.

VIMIUM  *vwt-317-vimium*

Vimium [http://vimium.github.io/] is an open source extension developed for 
Google Chrome and Chromium. It doesn't modify the browser's interface but 
focuses on allowing the user to navigate web pages, tabs and links using 
vim-like keyboard commands rather than the mouse. It also allows the user to 
map or customise its key bindings.

CVIM  *vwt-317-cvim*

cVim 
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh] 
is an open source extension for Google Chrome and Chromium. Like Vimium, cVim 
doesn't modify the browser's interface, but adds a number of Vim-like features 
and key bindings to Chrome.

VIMFX / VIMIUM FOR FIREFOX  *vwt-317-vimfx-/-vimium-for-firefox*

VimFx [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimfx/] is a fork of 
Vimium for Firefox [http://code.google.com/p/vimium-firefox/]. As its name 
suggest, it was inspired by Vimium for Chrome and like its inspiration 
provides keyboard navigation without modifying the browser chrome and UI like 
Vimperator.Vimium for Firefox hasn't been updated since October 2012 and has 
been replaced by VimFx which as of November 2015 is in active development.

VIMKEYBINDINGS  *vwt-317-vimkeybindings*

Vimkeybindings [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/52496] is a 
small addon for Firefox that adds only Vim hjkl keys, much like Konqueror, and 
g and G as home and end replacement. It is a useful extension for those who do 
not want to change the appearance and behaviour of their browser interface and 
/ or need extensions which rely on the status bar, etc.

SURFINGKEYS  *vwt-317-surfingkeys*

Surfingkeys [https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys] is an open source 
extension for Google Chrome and Firefox that adds Vim-like key bindings for 
navigation. It also has a versatile bookmark finder and a large cursor for 
visual mode. Javascript is used for user defined settings, and users can 
create their own key mappings.

WASAVI  *vwt-317-wasavi*

wasavi [https://github.com/akahuku/wasavi] is a free and open source 
extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera that can convert any standard text 
area into a vi editor, allowing the user to take advantage of most vi and a 
few Vim commands and features, as well as a selection of ex commands. Reading 
the README is recommended as some functions differ from standard vi / Vim.

VIM VIXEN  *vwt-317-vim-vixen*

Vim Vixen [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/] is a 
current (last edit Aug 18) vim plugin for Firefox. It provides keybindings for 
page navigation, link chasing, page changing, search etc... see complete list 
at link.

OLD INFORMATION  *vwt-317-old-information*

The following is from 2002, and may not be useful for recent versions of 
Firefox.

Finding the arrow keys on a laptop is annoying, when you simply want to 
scroll the web page. Here is how to customize Mozilla browsers to use the Vim 
h/j/k/l keys.
    - Locate your mozilla/res/builtin directory (varies by platform). You could 
      search for htmlBindings.xml to find it. (ie. locate htmlBindings.xml. 
    - On Mac OS X it's inside the Mozilla application bundle. 
      /Applications/Mozilla/Mozilla.app/Contents/MacOS/res/builtin. 
    - Create a new XML file called userHTMLBindings.xml, making it executable for 
      all users and making sure the CRLF format is the same as htmlBindings.xml. 
    - Place the following XML into the userHTMLBindings.xml file. 


>
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <bindings id="htmlBindings"
      xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/xbl";
      xmlns:xul="[http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"> http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul">];
      <binding id="browserUser">
       <handlers>
        <handler event="keypress" key="h" command="cmd_scrollLeft"/>
        <handler event="keypress" key="j" command="cmd_scrollLineDown"/>
        <handler event="keypress" key="k" command="cmd_scrollLineUp"/>
        <handler event="keypress" key="l" command="cmd_scrollRight"/>
       </handlers>
      </binding>
     </bindings>
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-317-comments*

I found this didn't work in userHTMLBindings.xml, but adding relevant lines 
in htmlBindings.xml works great (see bug 201011 
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201011]).

==============================================================================

It's a bit tricky to get this working. Double-check your file format (CRLF, 
LF, CR) for the platform you are on. Also check that you put the file in the 
right path for your OS. I've gotten this to work on Linux, Mac OS X, and 
Windows equally well. In some cases (Unix based environments) I think the 
files may need to be executable as well (in other words, where the other 
binding files were executable, I made the user binding executable as well).

==============================================================================

The tip worked on Netscape 7.0 on Windows. But it seemed like it worked only 
after removing the couple of ";' in the initial two lines which seemed 
unexpected.

==============================================================================

Using Vim keys in Opera (tested with 7.23 and 7.50). Close Opera while 
performing following modifications, which allow keys j/k to scroll up/down and 
h/l to go to previous/next page in history. Keys J/K/H/L navigate links in 
page.

>
    ; In directoy ~/.opera/keyboard/ there is file unix_keyboard.ini or something like that
    ; Under section [Application] add following items:
    k=Scroll up
    k shift=Navigate up
    j=Scroll down
    j shift=Navigate down
    l=Forward | Fast Forward
    l shift=Navigate right
    h=Back
    h shift=Navigate left
<

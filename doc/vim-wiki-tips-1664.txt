==============================================================================

When editing HTML documents containing images, you need to find out both the 
width and the length of each image and then feed every <img> tag.Just use perl 
by adding what follows into your vimrc file.When you hit F4, vim will get the 
image name and path mentioned in the "src" field of the <img> tag and will use 
perl to do this job for you.

COPY AND INSERT IMAGE SIZE INTO HTML CODE BY PRESSING A KEY *vwt-1664-copy-and-insert-image-size-into-html-code-by-pressing-a-key*

First step is to make sure you have Perl installed and the Perl module 
Image::Size. Then all you need is to add this to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

>
    " Get image size with F4 with perl Image::Size module.
    function! PerlImageSize()
      g/src
      normal $
      normal N
      normal 2w
      perl << EOF
      use Image::Size;
      $jo = VIM::Eval("expand('<cfile>')");
      $size = Image::Size::html_imgsize("$jo");
      VIM::Eval("setreg('a', '$size')");
    EOF
      normal $
      normal "ap
    endfunction
    nnoremap <F4> :call PerlImageSize()<CR>

TO DO
    - Another mysterious tip. What image? What does it do? What is the `$ N 2w` 
      stuff? 
    - An example is needed because clearly the author has something in mind, and 
      there is no need to perplex each reader of the tip. 
    - What is the `g/src`? 
    - The consecutive lines using `normal` can be combined to one. 
    - Check that the standard indenting I applied to the function does not break 
      the Perl code.

I think it's any image included in html with an <img> tag. But the tip obviously assumes some things about what has already been entered into the text and the formatting. These assumptions should be eliminated or documented. --Fritzophrenic 20:34, May 31, 2011 (UTC)

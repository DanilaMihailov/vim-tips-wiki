==============================================================================

Vim remembers the locations you have recently visited (where you jumped 
from). Each position (file name, column number, line number) is recorded in a 
jump list, and each window has a separate jump list that records the last 100 
positions where a jump occurred.

The commands that are regarded as "jumps" include searching, substitute and 
marks. Scrolling through a file is not regarded as jumping.

The jump list is saved between edits (provided the 'viminfo' option has the ' 
parameter), so you can see where jumps occurred from previous editing 
sessions. :help 'viminfo'

USING A JUMP LIST                                   *vtw-10-using-a-jump-list*

Like a web browser, you can go back, then forward:
    - Press Ctrl-O to jump back to the previous (older) location. 
    - Press Ctrl-I (same as Tab) to jump forward to the next (newer) location. 


Display the jump list for the current window with:

>
    :jumps
<

Your current location in the jump list is indicated with '>', and the first 
number in each row is a count that can be used to jump to that position. For 
example, after pressing Ctrl-O three times, the `:jumps` command may show 
something like this:

>
    jump line  col file/text
       4   102    0 somefile.txt
       3    93    0 -invalid-
       2    23    0 the current line 23 is shown here
       1    89   34 the current line 89 is shown here
    >  0    22   40 Display the jump list for the current window with:
       1    39    0 the current line 39 is shown here
       2   995    0 anotherfile.txt
       3    53  102 the current line 53 is shown here
<

Given the above, you could press:
    - Ctrl-I to jump to line 39 in the current buffer. 
    - Ctrl-O to jump to line 89 in the current buffer. 
    - `4` then Ctrl-O to jump to line 102 in file `somefile.txt`. 
    - `3` then Ctrl-I to jump to line 53 in the current buffer. 


In the example above:
    - The last line was added to the jump list when the first Ctrl-O was pressed 
      (so you can return to the initial position: line 53, column 102). 
    - Line 93 in the current buffer no longer exists (the jump location is 
      invalid). 


USING A SCRIPT TO SELECT A JUMP IN THE LIST *vtw-10-using-a-script-to-select-a-jump-in-the-list*

Using this vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] function, you can enter 
the number of a jump to go to the desired jump:

>
    function! GotoJump()
      jumps
      let j = input("Please select your jump: ")
      if j != ''
        let pattern = '\v\c^\+'
        if j =~ pattern
          let j = substitute(j, pattern, '', 'g')
          execute "normal " . j . "\<c-i>"
        else
          execute "normal " . j . "\<c-o>"
        endif
      endif
    endfunction
<

You can invoke the function in command mode:

>
    :call GotoJump()
<

After this, you will see the list of jumps and be asked to select a jump. If 
you type 4 and press Enter, it will take you back to the 4th jump. If you type 
+4 and press Enter, it will take you forward to the 4th jump in the list. If 
you press Escape, nothing happens.

You can also have a mapping for it, for example:

>
    nmap <Leader>j :call GotoJump()<CR>
<

    - Using marks |vtw-42| to manually record marks that you can return to 
    - List changes to the current file |vtw-1300| the change list records where 
      changes occurred 


REFERENCES                                                 *vtw-10-references*
    - :help |jump-motions| 
    - :help |jumplist| 
    - :help |:jumps| 


COMMENTS                                                     *vtw-10-comments*

You can also use `g;` and `g,` to move backward and forward in your edit 
locations.

One thing that may not be immediately evident is that this works only 
line-wise. You can't have more than one jump per-line. If you use any of the 
jump generator commands inside the line, only one jump is saved.

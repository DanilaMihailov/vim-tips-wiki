==============================================================================

A simple mapping to quickly set up a couple of VTreeExplorer 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=184] and TagList 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273] in the left side of 
your Vim window. Add the following to your vimrc:

>
    map <F12> <Esc>:Tlist<CR><C-W>h<C-W>s:VTreeExplore<CR>:set nonu<CR><C-W>l
<

The mapping does the following:
    - Opens the TagList (opens left by default). 
    - Switches to the TagList window and splits it. 
    - Opens VTreeExplorer in the split window. 
    - Turns of line numbering in the VTreeExplorer. 
    - Switches back to the window where you started.

Not sure if Tlist and VTreeExplore can be used with `|`, but consider 
(untested):

>
    map <F12> <Esc>:Tlist <Bar> wincmd h <Bar> wincmd s <Bar> VTreeExplore <Bar> set nonu <Bar> wincmd l<CR>
<

:help |:wincmd|

Also consider using 'nnoremap' and 'inoremap' and possibly 'vnoremap' rather 
than just 'map'.

Doing a lot of programming in Python, I need to switch quickly between Python 
module and corresponding unit-test module. Often there is one unit-testing 
module for multiple python modules.

This function allows you to switch to correct unit testing module quickly, 
using the filename hardcoded at the end of the file. Idea is stolen from 
Twisted sources.

Put this to your ftplugin/python.vim:

>
    nmap <buffer> <F5> :call JumpToTestFile()<CR>
    fun! JumpToTestFile()
      let line = getline("$")
      if line =~ "^### testfile: "
        let filename = strpart(line, 14)
        execute ":e " . filename
      else
        echo "TEST PATTERN ### testfile: NOT FOUND!"
      endif
    endfun

TO DO Fix indents in following, and combine/clean.

I created this general purpose script (some may disagree since I dropped down 
to python scripting; sorry, just don't have time to hunt through docs for vim 
script info!) ... but if you have python compiled in with your vim, and happen 
to use a test framework, this with very little tweaking may help.

I generally have a 1:1 correspondence between modules and test scripts, so 
this approach saves me having to put test file names in my source.

    inoremap <M-t> <Esc>:call UTestToggle()<CR>
    nnoremap <M-t> :call UTestToggle()<CR>
    function! UTestToggle()
    python << EOF
    # toggles between a path like: /myproject/person.py and /myproject/test/utest_person.py
    # could mkdir the 'test' directory if not exists, but chances are the user will
    # be doing that outside of vim anyway.
    import vim
    from os import path
    
    UTEST_PREFIX='test/utest_'
    curfile = vim.current.buffer.name
    if curfile:
     if UTEST_PREFIX in curfile:
     # switch to the matching source
     vim.command('e %s' % curfile.replace(UTEST_PREFIX, ''))
     else:
     # switch to the matching utest_filename.py|qpy
     filepath, filename = path.split(curfile)
     vim.command('e %s' % path.join(filepath, UTEST_PREFIX+filename))
    EOF

Minor change, my fault for not testing it a bit. This rev switches to a 
buffer if the file is already in vim's buffer list, rather than calling the 
edit command. Was seeing instances where unsaved changes were lost.Note: vim 
complains about free() when I run this; gvim doesn't appear to, although that 
may just be surpressed output.

UTEST_PREFIX='test/utest_'

def edit(target):

>
    # first try to load from buffer
    for buf in vim.buffers:
    if target == buf.name:
    vim.command('b!%s' % buf.number)
    return
    # must not be in buffers, open file
    vim.command('e! %s' % target)
    return
<

curfile = vim.current.buffer.nameif curfile:

>
    if UTEST_PREFIX in curfile:
    # switch to the matching source
    edit(curfile.replace(UTEST_PREFIX, ))
    else:
    # switch to the matching utest_filename.py|qpy
    filepath, filename = path.split(curfile)
    edit(path.join(filepath, UTEST_PREFIX+filename))

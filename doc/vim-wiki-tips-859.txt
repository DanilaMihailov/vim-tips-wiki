==============================================================================

There are many situations where you may want to count the number of lines 
between matching pairs of characters, such as parenthesises and braces. This 
can be especially useful when programming Java, C++, Perl.

Simply set the following:

>
    :set showcmd
<

After this, in bottomright corner of vim window you will see count of lines 
currently selected in visual mode (if there are any), among many other useful 
things.

Now, to see how many lines are between pairs, you set cursor on first pair, 
enter visual mode and press %. Now in bottom right corner you see desired 
number.

Or, for certain matched pairs like {...} groups in a C program, you can use a 
text object. For example, in C code, anywhere within matched braces, enter 
visual mode and press "iB" to select everything between the braces. The bottom 
right corner contains the desired count.

==============================================================================

This tip describes how to get the Vim source from the new Mercurial 
repository. It assumes that you know how to compile Vim once you have the 
source. Examples are for Linux but it shouldn't be hard to adapt them to 
whatever OS you're running on (provided of course that there exists a version 
of Mercurial that runs on your OS). Also, the examples are written for GNU 
make: in case of doubt, try replacing make by gmake everywhere.

Also take a look at the Mercurial instructions from vim.org 
[http://www.vim.org/mercurial.php].

FIRST TIME ONLY: CREATING YOUR REPOSITORY  *vwt-1653-first-time-only:-creating-your-repository*

MAKE SURE THAT MERCURIAL AND PYTHON ARE INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM  *vwt-1653-make-sure-that-mercurial-and-python-are-installed-on-your-system*

For example, check there is a program named hg and another named python in 
your PATH. If you haven't got Mercurial, install it, either (if available) by 
installing the Mercurial package from your distro, or else from the Mercurial 
site [http://mercurial.selenic.com/]. As of May 2010 the Python version 
required by the Mercurial package is Python 2.4, but it seems to work fine 
with later versions like Python 2.6.2.

If you're uncomfortable with a command-line interface (or simply prefer a 
GUI), there are options available such as TortoiseHg 
[http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/] to simplify common tasks with an 
easy-to-use GUI front-end. On Windows, the installer even includes Python and 
a command-line hg tool, so that you get everything you need in one package.

INSTALL A COPY OF BRAM'S LATEST SOURCE, RUNTIME AND ANCILLARY FILES  *vwt-1653-install-a-copy-of-bram's-latest-source,-runtime-and-ancillary-files*

1. Set up a directory head "for building" and cd to it, e.g. (on Linux)

>
    mkdir -p ~/.build/hg
    cd ~/.build/hg
<

2. Clone Bram's repository(this may take some time, depending on the speed of 
your CPU and Internet connection):

>
    (date && hg clone http://hg.256bit.org/vim vim) 2>&1 |tee hg-vim.log
<

The above is slightly more complicated than absolutely necessary because it 
can be useful to keep a running log. The important part starts with hg and 
ends immediately before the right parenthesis. Similarly for other hg commands 
below.

SIMPLE CASE: GETTING NEW PATCHES  *vwt-1653-simple-case:-getting-new-patches*

This applies if all of the following are true:
    - You have no local changes to the Vim source, ancillary and runtime files (including the Makefile; you can easily compile a custom Vim with no Makefile changes, as detailed in the compiling "how to" pages |vwt-1653-external-links| below)
    - You compile only one Vim and therefore don't use a shadow directory
    - You don't build a cscope database inside the Vim source tree


In this case, all you need to check for (and, if necessary, get) any changes 
to the Vim source is:

>
    cd ~/.build/hg/vim
    (date && hg pull -u) 2>&1 |tee -a ../hg-vim.log
<

COMPLEX CASE: YOU HAVE LOCAL CHANGES AND/OR COMPILE SEVERAL VIM VERSIONS  *vwt-1653-complex-case:-you-have-local-changes-and/or-compile-several-vim-versions*

ENABLE THE FETCH EXTENSION  *vwt-1653-enable-the-fetch-extension*

Add the following to the .hg/hgrc file in your repository (it was created by 
the clone process, with Bram's repository as the default remote source):

>
    [extensions]
    hgext.fetch =
<

No need to add anything after the equal sign, this extension comes packed 
with Mercurial (but disabled by default)

PATCH YOUR .HGIGNORE FILE  *vwt-1653-patch-your-.hgignore-file*

It is found at the top level of your repository. This step is unnecessary if 
you have neither additional help files nor additional Vim versions and you 
don't add a cscope database inside the Vim source tree.Copy the following 
patch and apply it with patch -p1 < hgignore.diff from the top directory where 
the file resides.

>
    diff -r 2bd29808d1f6 -r a5e628a08c4e .hgignore

<

Then commit this change:

>
    (date && hg commit -m 'Ignore shadow directories and help tag changes') 2>&1 |tee -a ../hg-vim.log
<

CREATE SHADOW DIRECTORIES  *vwt-1653-create-shadow-directories*

If you want to compile more than one version of Vim, create shadow 
directories to avoid conflicts between them. We create them with names 
starting with shadow- so .hgignore (after applying the above patch) will see 
them. Here is an example:

>
    cd ~/.build/hg/vim/src
    (date && SHADOWDIR='shadow-huge' make -e shadow) 2>&1 |tee -a ../../hg-vim.log
    (date && SHADOWDIR='shadow-tiny' make -e shadow) 2>&1 |tee -a ../../hg-vim.log
<

The -e command-line switch is necessary so that make won't override our 
SHADOWDIR names with the default which is just shadow

APPLY YOUR LOCAL CHANGES AND COMMIT THEM  *vwt-1653-apply-your-local-changes-and-commit-them*

You do this by editing the sources in the src directory. The case where you 
want to compile different versions of Vim with not only different 
configuration options but even different changes to the sources is not covered 
by the present tip, and neither is the case when your changes could conflict 
with Bram's (the changes I have consist of added sections in out-of-the-way 
parts of Makefile and feature.h plus Bill McCarthy's extra float functions).

Also, check that your "nonstandard" patches (if any) are mentioned in 
src/version.c so that they will appear in the :version output of your 
home-compiled Vim: here is the relevant part of mine, normally you would add 
one line (with a string followed by a comma) per extra patch with a /**/ 
comment between each of them:

>
    static char *(extra_patches[]) =
    {   /* Add your patch description below this line */
    /**/
    #ifdef FEAT_FLOAT
        "Extra float functions (Bill McCarthy)",
    #endif
    /**/
        NULL
    };
<

Then, commit your local changes with

>
    (date && hg commit -m 'Local source changes') 2>&1 |tee -a ../hg-vim.log
<

GET ANY NEW OFFICIAL PATCHES AND MERGE THEM WITH YOUR LOCAL ONES  *vwt-1653-get-any-new-official-patches-and-merge-them-with-your-local-ones*

>
    cd ~/.build/hg/vim
    (date && hg fetch --switch-parent) 2>&1 |tee -a ../hg-vim.log
<

The --switch-parent switch places the local directory (where changes are few 
and far between) as the "first" parent of any resulting merge, so that the 
local changes won't be removed and added back every time: this reduces the 
number of source files which make will see as "modified".

Before compiling, you may want to check any files listed as "merged" 
(possibly with the help of the hg diff function) to make sure that the changes 
are what you would expect.

THE MERCURIAL ONLINE HELP  *vwt-1653-the-mercurial-online-help*

In my experience, second only to the Vim help itself. It includes the whole 
contents of the manpages |vwt-1653-manpages|, and more.
    - hg help
    - hg help subject


where subject is a Mercurial command (e.g. pull) or other help subject (e.g. 
extensions).

Note: The full text of the help is only obtained with -v or --verbose, or when the [ui] section of your hgrc (or, on Windows, Mercurial.ini) contains the line verbose=1

KNOWN BUG: LOGGING AND INTERACTIVE MERGE  *vwt-1653-known-bug:-logging-and-interactive-merge*

A problem which I haven't solved about the above method of keeping a running 
log, is that is doesn't mesh well with Mercurial's "interactive merge tool": 
if the interactive merge asks a question, you don't see it, and you will have 
to blind-type a guessed response.

In my experience, questions are about runtime/doc/tags being deleted locally, 
reintroduced on the remote repository, and the question is "Use (c)changed 
version or leave (d)eleted?" -- in that case I reply d and the fetch goes on. 
I get this on the first non-null fetch after a "make install".

If you hit Ctrl-C to break the run, you won't see what Mercurial has output 
so far: it is not in the log; and your local repository is left in an 
uncertain state: once I did this, but then "hg status" replied nothing and "hg 
fetch" gave an error saying local files needed update -C or merge. Finally "hg 
merge" (with no logging) gave me the c/d question again so I could bring back 
my local repo to a "sane" state by replying d then manually committing the 
merge (with a -m message inspired by the "description" on the remote head, as 
obtained with "hg heads").

Workaround: First, use hg -v incoming (see below; -v means "verbose"). No need to log this since it makes no change to the repository. If it tells you "No changes found", no need to do anything more at the moment. Otherwise, it will tell you which files will be changed if you pull. Then if runtime/doc/tags is included, you know that fetch may stop until you type d<Enter>
— If there are many new changesets, and you want to exceptionally use (just this once) vim as a pager, repeat the command like this (all on one line):
hg -v --config 'extensions.hgext.pager=' --config 'pager.pager=view -' --config 'pager.attend=incoming' incoming

where the three --config arguments mean that this single command will be run as if your hgrc included the following (in addition tothe other lines already there):

>
    [extensions]
    hgext.pager=
    [pager]
    pager=view -
    attend=incoming
<

i.e. enable the pager extension, use "view -" i.e. Vim read-only from stdin, as a pager, and enable the pager for the hg incoming command. — Tonymec 21:42, July 7, 2010 (UTC)

==============================================================================

I finally found how to force Python programs (including Mercurial, which is 
written in Python) to always use unbuffered I/O on stdin, stdout and stderr. 
Simple: set the environment variable to some nonempty string.

Example (for the shell on Unix-like systems):

>
    cd ~/.build/hg/vim
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED='unbuffered' (date && hg fetch --switch-parent) 2>&1 |tee -a ../hg-vim.log
<CAUTION: It might be unwise to do this in your permanent environment, since unbuffering means more frequent and smaller transfers, thus reducing throughput. You may want to do it only when logging via

USEFUL COMMANDS TO "GET INFORMATION"  *vwt-1653-useful-commands-to-"get-information"*
    - hg -v help
    - hg -v help |less


what are the basic hg commands, and what do they do?
    - hg -v help 


(where command is a Mercurial command) what are the possible arguments to that command (and what do they mean)?(-v or --verbose is necessary to get the full text of the concerned help section)
    - hg status


are there local files waiting for a disposition (commit possibly preceded by add and/or forget)? The reply is one filename per line, preceded by A (added to the list of tracked files), M (merged), D (deleted i.e. specifically not tracked), ? (new file, neither "tracked" nor "not tracked" yet).
    - hg heads


what are all the "tree leaves" ? (commits which are not a parent to a later commit)
    - hg log -l 


(where N is a number): show the N latest commits, with relative number and short hash, branch name if any, tags if any, parent(s) if not, or not only, the immediately older commit, and description (commit message)
    - hg log -l  -f


same as above, but only for the current tip and its parents and ancestors.
    - hg incoming


tells you (in the same format as hg log) which changesets (if any) are waiting for you to pull them.
    - hg diff -r xxxxxxxxxxxx [-r yyyyyyyyyyyy] [ ...]


where xxxxxxxxxxxx (and yyyyyyyyyyyy if present) are revision IDs: Produce a diff of the file(s) named, as they changed between the named revisions. With only one revision: compare it to the current tip. With no filenames: give all differences between these revisions.
Notes:

 Contrary to what is said in the manpage, with no revision there is no output.
 I find it useful to use |view - as a pager for the output of this command. Then a simple :saveas patchname.diff will, if you want to, create the patch file after you review it.
 To always use view as pager for the more "bulky" output-producing Mercurial commands, add the following to your ~/.hgrc file (or, on Windows, your %USERPROFILE%\Mercurial.ini):

>
    [extensions]
    hgext.pager=
    [pager]
    pager = view -
    attend = annotate, cat, diff, export, glog, log, qdiff

CHANGING BRANCHES  *vwt-1653-changing-branches*

Changing branches, or going to a "tagged" revision, are two of the functions 
of the hg update command (which has up as an alias) — in general, its function 
is to "update" the files in the current repository (the "working copy" as 
Mercurial names it) to any revision you specify. So:

>
    hg up vim72
<

>
    hg up default
<

(only for 7.3.142 or later)

>
    hg up v7-3-155
<

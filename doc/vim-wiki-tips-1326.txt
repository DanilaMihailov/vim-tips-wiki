On a US keyboard, it is convenient to press `[` and `]` which each have their 
own key.

You can have the same convenience on non-US keyboards with a map like the 
following (this example is for a German keyboard):

>
    map ü <C-]>
    map ö [
    map ä ]
    map Ö {
    map Ä }
    map ß /
<

A key like `ü` is only useful in insert mode, and you can still use it in 
that mode.

Enter is heavily used and - in Turkish Q keyboard layout - far from hand 
position so it is productive to use "ş" character as <cr> in normal mode. That 
way the keyboard characters are lay like G H J K L Ş which boosts performance. 
It is also possibly a good idea to use "ğ" as a mapleader key which lays just 
above Ş.

==============================================================================

nmap ş <cr>
 let mapleader = "ğ"   " in your .vimrc file

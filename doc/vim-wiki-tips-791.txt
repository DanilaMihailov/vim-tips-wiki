==============================================================================

Occasionally when you've pasted into Vim from some other application, you get 
a pesky visible non-ascii character. You can do a ga command to see what it 
is, but you might want to search for it or substitute it.

Here's a technique. Place the cursor on the character, then:

>
    yl # yank one character into unnamed buffer
    /<C-R><C-R>" # pull unnamed buffer contents onto search (that's two presses of Control-R)
<

COMMENTS  *vwt-791-comments*

See file format [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/File_format] for more details if 
the character in question is a Carriage Return (^M or \r).

==============================================================================

Try ^V^M (two CTRL+keystrokes).

For cleaning up win/dos text files for *nix, there's dos2unix (aka fromdos).

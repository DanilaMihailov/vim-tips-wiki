==============================================================================

Until vim 5.8, I was using the cfile, clist etc for quickfix mode.

In vim6.x, I found out that :cw will boost my productivity as a programmer.

To make, type :make as we do in older versions of vim (<6.0).

Instead of clist, cfile, etc., type

>
    :cw<enter>
<

you get one split window, in which errors are listed. Current error line will 
be highlighted and cursor will move to the corresponding source file line.

Pressing Enter on any error line in the error window will take the cursor to 
the corresponding source line.

This eliminates the need for the process described in VimTip345 
|vwt-345|.(Now you can get rid of Visual studio altogether !)

I guess I should say what works for me for compiling Java programs on MS 
Windows. It can be improved, but I am not sure how. I put the following in 
_vimrc.

>
    set makeprg=javac
    set makeef=c:\dev\src\errors.txt
    set shellpipe=2>
    set errorformat=%A%f:%l:\ %m,%C%m
    noremap <M-1> :w<CR>:set ch=5<CR>:make -d C:\\dev\\classes %:p<CR>
    noremap <M-2> :cp<CR>
    noremap <M-3> :cn<CR>
    noremap <M-4> :cl<CR>
<

Press Alt-1 to compile the current file. Alt-2 and Alt-3 move the cursor in 
the source code to previous and next errors. (I have another command to reset 
the command line height when I'm done looking at errors.)

Problem: it removes spaces so the caret that javac uses to point to the error 
location is wrong. I have tried all kinds of different formats. If someone 
does not know a better error format for javac, I just discoved that :set 
shellpipe= will open DOS window with all the spaces preserved.

==============================================================================

Jar files are zip files, and you can browse them from within Vim simply by 
treating them the same as Vim treats zip files.

If you want to figure out how to do this yourself, read :help |new-filetype| 
and zipPlugin.vim. The latter is a plugin distributed with Vim: in Vim, put 
the cursor on `$VIMRUNTIME/plugin/zipPlugin.vim` and type `gf`.

For impatient people, just place the following in a file named 
`~/.vim/ftdetect/jar.vim` (on Unix systems) or 
`$HOME/vimfiles/ftdetect/jar.vim` (on Windows systems):

>
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.jar,*.war,*.ear,*.sar,*.rar set filetype=zip
<

If you open a jar file in Vim, you will be able to browse it. If that does 
not work, update to a recent version of Vim with zipPlugin installed.

From :help |zip-extension| a .jar file can be unzipped with the following in 
vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

>
    au BufReadCmd *.jar call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))

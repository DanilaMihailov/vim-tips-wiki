==============================================================================

Vim can interact with the tricks that the latest xdvi or kdvi does:
    - If one clicks at some place in xdvi (usually Ctrl+Button1), Vim automatically 
      jumps to the corresponding line in the LaTeX source file ("reverse search") 
    - Also, from inside Vim, one can jump to the corresponding line in xdvi which 
      becomes highlighted ("forward search"). 


First of all, the latex document need to tell the latex compiler to set marks 
in the dvi file. Only put:

>
    \usepackage{srcltx}
<

in the preamble of your latex document, or compile with:

>
    latex --src [your_file.tex]
<

It works perfectly well with Vim or gvim on one side and xdvi on the other 
side, even with multiple couple (vim, xdvi). It works also fine with kdvi but 
can be a little less "smooth".

WITH XDVI  *vwt-225-with-xdvi*

It's very simple. In your .vimrc file, add at the end:

>
    :map \ld :execute '!xdvi -editor "vim --servername 'v:servername' --remote +\%l \%f" -sourceposition ' . line(".") . expand("%") . " '" . expand(Tex_GetMainFileName(':r')) . ".dvi' >/dev/null&" <CR><CR>
<

and in your .bashrc:

>
    alias vim='vim --servername vimtex'
<

The first allows the forward search by \ld in normal mode.

To allow the reverse search, Vim has to be opened with vimtex servername; 
that's the reason for the second line. (I don't use the normal shortcut \ls as 
that doesn't allow me to use the v:servername variable, see end of this tip.)

Keep in mind that any other program that communicates with Vim server should 
be aware of the name change (for example jabref). A little script like ouvre 
[http://web.archive.org/web/20090715013750/http://corentin.barbu.free.fr/codes/stable/ouvre] 
can avoid to systematically name the Vim server "vimtex".

Note: On my system (Ubuntu 8-10, with the latex-suite installed via 
vim-addon-manager) this works, but only if I substitute 'gvim' for 'vim'. 
Also, for things to work I must, in order, 1) Open my tex file with gvim, 2) 
Open my dvi file with the command \ld 3) reverse-search using Ctrl + 
left-mouse-click.

WITH KDVI  *vwt-225-with-kdvi*

If you run it on gnu/linux, I've made a little script to do the work for you 
(for use with Vim): install_fsearch_kdvi.sh 
[http://corentin.barbu.free.fr/codes/stable/install_fsearch_kdvi.sh] but this 
doesn't allow running multiple couples of (vim, kdvi). The tips for xdvi would 
apply, but I've no more time to set it.

Then in kdvi in "configuration> configure kdvi > dvi specificity" set Editor 
to "vim".

You can then forward search in Vim or gvim by \lf in normal mode.

If you want to use it from gvim only, in the script change:

>
    echo "alias vim='vim --servername KDVI'" >> ~/.bashrc
<

to

>
    echo "alias gvim='gvim --servername KDVI'" >> ~/.bashrc
<

It works by a little script in your ~/bin/ directory.

Here is the install script:

>
    #!/bin/bash
    script_name=~/bin/fsearch_kdvi.sh
    if [[ ! -e ~/bin ]] ; then
    mkdir ~/bin/
    fi
    # setting the script for forward search
    echo "#"'!'"/bin/bash" > $script_name
    echo "doc_dvi=\${1%.tex}.dvi" >> $script_name
    echo "ligne=\$2" >> $script_name
    echo "doc_partie=\$3" >> $script_name
    echo "kdvi -u file:\$doc_dvi\#src:\$ligne\$doc_partie &" >> $script_name
    echo "exit 0" >> $script_name
    
    chmod +x $script_name
    
    # setting of vim for forward search
    echo "\" \" To use kdvi forward search, comment it if you don't want to." >> ~/.vimrc
    echo ":map \\lf :execute \""'!'"$script_name \". Tex_GetMainFileName()\" \". line(\".\")\" \".expand(\"%\")\"& \" <CR><CR> " >> ~/.vimrc
    
    echo "# To use reverse search with kdvi" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "alias vim='vim --servername KDVI'" >> ~/.bashrc
    
    exit 0

WINDOWS TIP  *vwt-225-windows-tip*

If you use the MikTeX distribution on Win32, you can play the same game with 
Vim and yap. I use the following with Vim 6.0 and (old) MikTeX 1.20b.

From my Vim script for tex files:

>
    execute '!start yap -1 -s' line(".") . expand("%:t") expand("%:p:r")
<

(Of course, I have a :map and :menu to do this.) This expands to something 
like:

>
    !start yap -1 -s 1353foo.tex c:\path\to\foo
<

In yap, from the View/Options panel, choose the "Inverse Search" tab and 
enter:

>
    gvim --remote +%l %f
<

in the "Command line" box. This can probably be improved: doesn't the 
installer put a .bat file somewhere?

==============================================================================

The following mapping may also be useful (in one line):

>
    map _g :exe 'silent !xdvi -editor "vim --servername ' . v:servername . ' --remote +\%l \%f" -sourceposition ' . line (".") . expand("%") . " " . expand("%:r") . ".dvi &" \| redraw!<CR>
<

It starts up an xdvi (if necessary) and does a forward search. Reverse search 
will jump to the location in the same Vim.

==============================================================================

As a followup to benji's excellent tip for yap, (win32)the command :!start as 
opposed to :! does a kind of fork, so Vim won't wait for the executed program 
to finish.

That is, type:

>
    exe 'silent !start yap -1 -s' line(".") . expand("%:t") expand("%:r") .'.dvi'
<

so you don't have to close yap before Vim becomes responsive again. See :help 
|:!start|.

==============================================================================

I make use of the above a lot, and it usually works great. However, to handle 
spaces in the file path, it needs a little modification:

>
    exe 'silent !start yap -1 -s' line(".") . expand("%:t") '"' . expand("%:r") . '.dvi' . '"'
<

The corresponding mapping (to _g) is:

>
    map _g :exe 'silent !start yap -1 -s' line(".") . expand("%:t") '"' . expand("%:r") . '.dvi' . '"'<CR><CR>
<

==============================================================================

I am using the following in my ~/.Xdefaults:

>
    xdvi.editor: gvim --servername %f --remote-silent +%l %f
<

With the advantage that I can have multiple Xdvi instances with different 
files and they all know, what Vim they have to address to.

Also, you may have multiple Xdvi instances with the same file and they will 
all interact with the same Vim.

==============================================================================

There's not clientserver support on vanilla Vim [to be verified as it works 
well now with Vim].

==============================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVING  *vwt-225-problem-solving*

This part has been partly reviewed, other contributors welcome.

0-Check the configuration of the source file (file.tex)

Check you've got the package srcltx.sty and \usepackage{srcltx} (which should 
be commented out when one finishes and is ready for printing etc).

If you do not have the LaTeX package srctex, try compiling your file with:

>
    latex --src [your_file.tex]
<

which works for me.

XDVI  *vwt-225-xdvi*

Forward and reverse search only works for quite recent xdvi versions (>= 
22.38), (or recent Unix/Linux versions), xdvi can interact with any editor 
provided with a client-server mode.Vim as to be compiled with the 
client-server option, on Ubuntu 8.04 it's ok, for gvim it's usually the case. 
On Linux Mandrake 9.0. gvim is compiled with the client-server option and Vim 
is not.

1-Check that your xdvi version provides the "source-special" functions, by 
typing 'xdvi -version' or 'man xdvi'

2-Configuration of xdvi

xdvi has to be called with the following options

>
    xdvi -editor 'gvim --remote-wait +%l %f' file.dvi &
<

(or with 'xterm -e vim --remote-wait +%l %f' if Vim has been compiled with 
the client-server option).

To make it easier to use you can define an environment variable XEDITOR to 
set the value of 'editor' or add the following line in your .Xdefaults 
xdvi.editor: gvim --remote-wait +%l %f Launch 'xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults' to 
make sure that xdvi.editor is set to the good value. If you have defined such 
a variable, xdvi will always be launched with the -editor option. To avoid 
this unsafe behavior, launch 'xdvi -safer'.

3-Conversely, if you call xdvi within gvim with the -sourceposition option, 
cursor is placed in the dvi file on the corresponding position.

Syntax is:

>
    xdvi -sourceposition l:cfile.tex file.dvi
<

l is the line number, c is the column number

Be careful: there is no space between "c" (column number) and file.tex.

To make it easier to use, you can do the following.

First create a file named for example xdvi_source.vim with following lines.

>
    " This script calls xdvi source and puts cursor in xdvi viewer at
    " the position corresponding to the position in the source file
    :exec "silent !xdvi -sourceposition ".line(".").':'.col(".")."%".' '."%:r.dvi"
<

Then launch the following command within gvim editing the .tex source file. 
Pressing simultaneously Ctrl and → will open the dvi file at the right 
position:

>
    :noremap <buffer> <C-Right> :so xdvi_source.vim<CR>
<

Seems it doesn't work for multiple tex source files.

==============================================================================

You don't actually need to create that extra file (I prefer my directories to 
be 'clean' and I always forget to copy the necessary files when starting a new 
document in a new directory). You can just type:

>
    :noremap <buffer> <C-Right> :exec "silent !xdvi -sourceposition ".line(".").':'.col(".")."%".' '."%:r.dvi"<CR>
<

The problem I run into very often, though, is that I often split my LaTeX 
source into multiple files (usually one per chapter). The problem is that

>
    "%:r.dvi"
<

is than usually wrong (e.g. it should be book.dvi, while the file being 
edited is chapter1.tex). I think it should be possible to check for files in 
the directory containing the pattern "{include}\|{input}\{%<" in which case it 
is PROBABLY this file that will result in the dvi. No way to be sure though, 
so it is probably best to have a texrc file for every project (extra file, 
darn!).

If it doesn't work with previous tips, getting xdvi work without support for 
multiple couple xdvi/vim works by adding:

>
    :let g:Tex_ViewRule_dvi = 'xdvi -editor "vim --servername vimtex --remote +\%l \%f"'
<

To your .vimrc file and aliasing "vim" to "vim --servername vimtex"

==============================================================================

I split my LaTeX source into multiple files and directories. I use a main 
directory with the main .tex file and a tree of directories for each chapter. 
To fix this tip I used:

>
    :map \ld :execute '!cd ' . expand(Tex_GetMainFileName(':p:h')) . ' && xdvi -editor "gvim --servername 'v:servername' --remote-wait +\%l \%f" -sourceposition ' . line(".") . substitute(expand('%:p'),expand(Tex_GetMainFileName(':p:h')).'\/','','') . " " . expand(Tex_GetMainFileName(':p:r')) . ".dvi &" <CR><CR>
<

==============================================================================

KDVI  *vwt-225-kdvi*

For kdvi the command should read:

>
    kdvi file:name.dvi#src:lname.tex
<

where l is the linenumber and name is the filename.

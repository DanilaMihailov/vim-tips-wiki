==============================================================================

Do you ever wanted to append lines from various sources (or to copy data from 
some application without any reasonable export method) to one file?

Here is a pretty simple solution for Vim. Just copy all you need to the 
clipboard and Vim can do the rest.

First you need to start Vim, open desired buffer (named buffer required as 
script do autosave) and run TrackClipboard function:

>
    :call TrackClipboard('==============================================================')
<

The function monitors the clipboard; when it is changed, add data to 
clipboard (or do whatever you want).

>
    function! TrackClipboard(delim)
      let timer1 = 0
      let temp = @*
      while @*!='EOF'
        if temp != @*
          let temp = @*
          $put =a:delim
          $put =temp
        else
          " autowrite and redraw every cca 5s
          let timer1 += 1
          if timer1 >= 100
            if &modified
              write
              redraw
            endif
            let timer1 = 0
          else
            sleep 50ms
          endif
        endif
      endwhile
    endfunction

    - CaptureClipboard [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3246] 
      contains a greatly enhanced plugin that is based on this tip. It offers 
      feedback on the number of captures, trimming of white space, append as well as 
      prepend not just to the end of the buffer, arbitrary delimiters and many 
      configurable defaults.

    " to automatically save modified buffer, and simplify your function.
    :set autosave
<

The 'autosave' option is in the todo list, but as of Vim 7.3.000 not yet implemented. -- Inkarkat 13:19, September 20, 2010 (UTC)

==============================================================================

Use `:set paste` to avoid autoindent applying to pasted text, in a terminal.

Also, you may need `:set noexpandtab` to stop Vim from expanding tabs to 
spaces.

This is not necessary; the :put command that is used in the function already inserts the text literally. -- Inkarkat 13:19, September 20, 2010 (UTC)

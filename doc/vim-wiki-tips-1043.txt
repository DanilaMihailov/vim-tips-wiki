==============================================================================

Let's say you copy and pasted a bunch of output from CVS like this:

>
    /opt/data/cvs/ofc/ofc/R1/wlthmgmt/common/feeds/state/logship.state.conf,v  <-- logship.state.conf
    new revision: 1.4; previous revision: 1.3
    done
    Checking in statemch/logship.statemch.conf;
    /opt/data/cvs/ofc/ofc/R1/wlthmgmt/common/feeds/statemch/logship.statemch.conf,v  <--  logship.statemch.conf
    new revision: 1.4; previous revision: 1.3
    done
    Checking in swift/logship.swift.conf;
    /opt/data/cvs/ofc/ofc/R1/wlthmgmt/common/feeds/swift/logship.swift.conf,v  <-- logship.swift.conf
    new revision: 1.3; previous revision: 1.2
    done
    Checking in tmark/logship.tmark.conf;
    /opt/data/cvs/ofc/ofc/R1/wlthmgmt/common/feeds/tmark/logship.tmark.conf,v  <-- logship.tmark.conf
    new revision: 1.4; previous revision: 1.3
<

and you want to submit the filename and revision as a promotion request.

You can do a bunch of ":s/foo//" commands to get rid some of the junk there, 
and a ":g/^Check/d" and ":g/^done" to get rid of the extraneous line and you'd 
be left with maybe something like this:

>
    wlthmgmt/common/feeds/bank53/logship.53.conf
    -- 1.4 -- install
    wlthmgmt/common/feeds/bankamer/logship.bankamer.conf
    -- 1.2 -- install
    wlthmgmt/common/feeds/bankamer/logship.pos.conf
    -- 1.4 -- install
    wlthmgmt/common/feeds/bankamer/logship.txn.conf
    -- 1.5 -- install
    wlthmgmt/common/feeds/bny/logship.bny.conf
    -- 1.3 -- install
<

What would you do to "join" the lines with filenames with lines with versions 
and commands? What *would* you do!?

>
    g/conf/j
<

It could be anything on the line with the filename on it, but you want to say 
globally search for "whatever" (conf) in this case, and do the ex/ed command 
"j" on it which joins it with the next line.

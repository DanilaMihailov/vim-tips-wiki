Perl's Data-Base-Independent (DBI) module provides programming language level 
access to a lot of databases.

Vim hosts an embedded Perl interpreter. So it is only a matter of some key 
strokes to interactively issue DB commands from within Vim or to search, edit, 
and replace database contents including retrieval and storage. Of course 
"create table" scripts can be worked upon in Vim as well as storing recurring 
patterns in Vim functions or Perl modules.

Prerequisites: Vim needs to be compiled with Perl support enabled. See the 
|if_perl.txt| manual page! The CPAN module DBI as well as an appropriate 
database driver has to be installed with Perl in order to execute these Vim 
commands:

>
    " connect to perl's dbi module:
    :perl use dbi;
    " connect to the database:
    :perl $dbh = dbi->connect( "DBI:mysql:$DBNAME:$HOST",$USER,$PASSWORD,
     { raiseerror => 1});
    " perform a simple query:
    :perl $result = $dbh->selectall_arrayref("show tables;");
    " insert the list of tables into the current buffer's top:
    :perl $curbuf->Append(0, map($_->[0], @{$result}));
<

In MySql the command "show tables;" results in a list of table names. 
Inserted into a Vim buffer this results in one line per table.

When I have a some SQL in vim that I want to see the results of, I use this 
simple technique to send it to Postgres:

1. Highlight the the SQL.

2. :!psql -d my _database (for Postgres)

Vim will filter my lines through that command replace them with the result 
set. When I'm done reviewing the results, I use "u" to undo the change.

If I repeat this cycle, I can use use :CTRL-P to get back the previous 
command to use, and instead of typing it again.

For larger pieces of SQL, I put it in a file and use:

>
    :!psql -d my_db -f %
    to send the whole script to Postgres.

Running an external process is the way Emacs handles database queries as 
well. Cursors and other database programming are not possible this way.

Perl's DBI module provides the Vim user with full interactive access to the 
database in the same way as used by graphical user interfaces and application 
programs. Also the single process solution (editor + database access in one 
process) opens only a single permanent database connection which is much 
quicker and allows bigger transactions.

Similar motivations led to the programming language Tcl: Why should one embed 
a command interpreter into application programs? The answer after many years 
of Tcl is given by a lot of scripts weaving together all kinds of programs as 
well as Tcl's graphical user interface library Tk which is also used for Perl.

For example Linux consists on one hand of many (text) files, which can be 
edited by Vim, and on the other hand of many complex relations between them, 
which can be handled effectively by a relational database. Merging Vim's many 
facilities with those of databases makes it possible to build a simple yet 
effective digital library with only the means at hand.

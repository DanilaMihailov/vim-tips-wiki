==============================================================================

With the addition of folding, Vim6 can function as a high performance outline 
processor. Simply :set ai and in insert mode use backspace to promote and tab 
to demote headlines.

In command mode, << promotes (n<< to promote multiple lines), and >> demotes. 
Also, highlight several headlines and < or > to promote or demote.

`:set foldmethod=indent` and then your z commands can expand or collapse 
headline trees, filewide or by the tree.

==============================================================================

Folds are useful to temporarily hide text that you don't currently need to 
see. By default, when you search for text, each fold containing a search hit 
automatically opens when you find the hit. This behavior is controlled with 
the 'foldopen' option (abbreviated to 'fdo').

To search only in open folds (unfolded text):

>
    :set fdo-=search
<

With the above, a search shows one hit per fold that contains the search 
target. The fold is not opened, and is only found once, even if it contains 
several instances of the search target.

You can also perform commands only on lines in open folds. For example, the 
following command will change every 'old' to 'new', but only in lines that are 
not folded:

>
    :folddoopen s/old/new/ge
<

With `:folddoopen`, each unfolded line is marked. Then the command 
(`s/old/new/ge`) is executed on each marked line. Therefore the `s///` command 
has no range (it operates on the current line), and it has the `e` flag so no 
error is shown if a line does not contain 'old'.

I'm seeing some weird messages from Vim 7.2 when using the above to 
s/old/new/ in text with several closed folds. The command works, but it shows 
a spurious "x substitutions on n lines" message (x and n are too big). Any 
thoughts? --JohnBeckett [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:JohnBeckett] 00:05,

==============================================================================

This tip shows how to use Vim from within a pop-up gnome terminal as an 
alternative to using gvim. Because most graphical terminals accept a "command 
string" that is executed when they start running, the technique shown here is 
easily generalized to other terminal types.

VIM-GNOME                                                 *vwt-1655-vim-gnome*

Many applications can be configured with an external pop-up editor, but 
require "popping up" to be the editor's default mode (for example, File Roller 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Roller], the GNOME desktop archive editor). 
This is a problem when you do not have gvim installed, or when you simply 
prefer to use "normal" Vim from within your preferred terminal (for example, 
gnome-terminal).

Create a file named vim-gnome with the following contents, and place it on 
your execution PATH (and use chmod +x vim-gnome to make vim-gnome executable):

>
    #!/bin/sh
    ARGS="$@"
    gnome-terminal -e "vim $ARGS"
<

This wrapper handles passing extra arguments to Vim, so you can enter things 
like vim-gnome myfile.txt +42 to edit myfile.txt and jump to line 42.

Now you can use vim-gnome everywhere that you could have used gvim, or any 
other pop-up editor.

COMMENTS                                                   *vwt-1655-comments*

To have the gnome-terminal not close when exiting vim, try this:

>
    #!/bin/sh
    ARGS="$@"
    gnome-terminal -x sh -c "vim $ARGS; $SHELL"
<

Now you should get a normal gnome-terminal when exiting vim with the :q 
command.

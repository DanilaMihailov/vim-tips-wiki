==============================================================================

By default, when pressing left/right cursor keys, Vim will not move to the 
previous/next line after reaching first/last character in the line. This can 
be quite annoying for new users. Fortunately this behaviour can be easily 
changed by putting this in your vimrc file:

>
    set whichwrap+=<,>,h,l,[,]
<

This causes the left and right arrow keys, as well as `h` and `l`, to wrap 
when used at beginning or end of lines. ( < > are the cursor keys used in 
normal and visual mode, and `[ ]` are the cursor keys in insert mode).

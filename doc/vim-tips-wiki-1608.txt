==============================================================================

This tip describes how to use C++ code completion in Vim (omni completion).

When editing a C++ file, enter the command `:set omnifunc?` to see what 
completion function is currently used. If the result is 
`omnifunc=ccomplete#Complete`, it means you are using the C completion 
provided with Vim (not C++). If your `:set omnifunc?` is not set as desired or 
maybe empty this is a good workaround for C++ files:

>
    au BufNewFile,BufRead,BufEnter *.cpp,*.hpp set omnifunc=omni#cpp#complete#Main
<

The following procedure provides C++ completion.

REQUIRED SETUP                                       *vtw-1608-required-setup*

1. Install OmniCppComplete 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520]. See its 
`doc/omnicppcomplete.txt` file for information.

2. Make a directory, for example `~/.vim/tags` that will hold your ctags.

3. Create stdc++ tags: Download and unpack the modified libstdc++ headers 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2358] to 
`~/.vim/tags/cpp_src`

4. Run ctags:

>
    $ cd ~/.vim/tags
    $ ctags -R --sort=1 --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q --language-force=C++ -f cpp cpp_src
<

5. Add additional tags (change to your system/likings):

>
    $ ctags -R --sort=yes --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q --language-force=C++ -f gl /usr/include/GL/   # for OpenGL
    $ ctags -R --sort=yes --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q --language-force=C++ -f sdl /usr/include/SDL/ # for SDL
    $ ctags -R --sort=yes --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q --language-force=C++ -f qt4 /usr/include/qt4/ # for QT4
<

6. Edit your ~/.vimrc and change to your system/likings:

>
    " configure tags - add additional tags here or comment out not-used ones
    set tags+=~/.vim/tags/cpp
    set tags+=~/.vim/tags/gl
    set tags+=~/.vim/tags/sdl
    set tags+=~/.vim/tags/qt4
    " build tags of your own project with Ctrl-F12
    map <C-F12> :!ctags -R --sort=yes --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .<CR>
    
    " OmniCppComplete
    let OmniCpp_NamespaceSearch = 1
    let OmniCpp_GlobalScopeSearch = 1
    let OmniCpp_ShowAccess = 1
    let OmniCpp_ShowPrototypeInAbbr = 1 " show function parameters
    let OmniCpp_MayCompleteDot = 1 " autocomplete after .
    let OmniCpp_MayCompleteArrow = 1 " autocomplete after ->
    let OmniCpp_MayCompleteScope = 1 " autocomplete after ::
    let OmniCpp_DefaultNamespaces = ["std", "_GLIBCXX_STD"]
    " automatically open and close the popup menu / preview window
    au CursorMovedI,InsertLeave * if pumvisible() == 0|silent! pclose|endif
    set completeopt=menuone,menu,longest,preview
<



USING OMNI COMPLETION                         *vtw-1608-using-omni-completion*

When everything is set up properly you can use the code completion. Make sure 
the 'filetype' of your file is set to `cpp`. You can check this by doing `:set 
filetype?`. If your 'filetype' isn't `cpp`, you might have to enable file type 
detection by adding `filetype on` to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], and restart Vim.

Now start typing (for me this only works if std:: is indented; otherwise I 
get Omni-completion (^0^N^P) Pattern not found):

>
    std::
<

A box opens with suggestions. You can use <C-N> and <C-P> to navigate. 
<C-X><C-O> opens the omnicompletion manually. A preview window should also 
appear on the top which shows the signature of functions and the like. Choose 
`vector` and continue:

>
    std::vector<int> vi;
    vi.
<

Another box opens with suggestions. Choose `push_back(` and continue.

As you can see this is a really nice feature which is especially handy when 
you use an external library which you don't know very well. Simply create the 
tags as described above and browse through the suggestions.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION                       *vtw-1608-additional-information*

It is nice to have the headers of the used libs really on your system so the 
preview window has something to show. So don't delete the headers after 
creating the tag files.

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1608-comments*

If you want completion to work for local variables in your code, you have to 
add the '`+l`' (letter "l" from local) option to the `c++-kinds` argument, as 
in:

>
    map <C-F12> :!ctags -R --c++-kinds=+pl --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .<CR>
<

Some recent edits have introduced `--sort=1` (the "1" should be "yes") and 
`--sort=yes`. I believe ctags defaults to `sort=yes` so these edits are not 
necessary. I'm wondering if the edits are useful. JohnBeckett

The autocompletion does *NOT* work for boost shared pointers. So for example, 
if there is a section of code that looks like:

>
    boost::shared_ptr<const ObjectType> someObject=boost::shared_ptr<const ObjectType>(new ObjectType());
    int member = someObject->getMember();
<

The getMember method will not show up in the dropdown list, because ctags is 
enabled for ObjectType, not when it's wrapped inside a boost shared pointer. 
If anyone knows a work around for this, it would be very useful for those C++ 
programmers who work with Boost.

==============================================================================

I suggest to use GCCSense at http://cx4a.org/software/gccsense 
[http://cx4a.org/software/gccsense], or clang_complete at script#3302 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3302] to have good C++ 
autocompletion that works with modern C++ code (e.g boost).

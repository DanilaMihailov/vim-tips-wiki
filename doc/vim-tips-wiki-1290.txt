==============================================================================

After I upgraded to Vim 7, I had problems when using the arrow keys for 
navigation in insert mode. The problem was the classic one where lines with A, 
B or D were inserted when I used the arrows.

The problem only showed up in Vim console mode and not in gvim so I thought 
that the problem might be in the terminal settings.

That assumption was correct and a single command fixed the problem:

>
    :set term=builtin_ansi
<

Now the arrowkeys worked again. I guess that all of the builtin term types 
will work and even some others. Mine was set to xterm which did not work.

I have almost the same problem... By the upgrade was to 7.1, and the effect 
was that for xterm's left and right arrows would jump from word to word!!!

Changing the "t_kl" and "t_kr" mapping (which was incorrect) to anything else 
had no effect on this. Only changing the "term" setting to either "ansi" or 
"builtin_ansi" fixed the problem.

Unfortunately changing terminal, breaks the use of function keys, and the use 
of an alternate editing display in xterms. That is editing will overwrite the 
previous command output.

    - This seems to be a bug in vim [http://bugs.gentoo.org/212546] --219.97.14.230

      February 2009 (UTC) - A bug in Vim? Hm, rather, this kind of behaviour is 
      usually due to termcap/terminfo settings not corresponding to what the 
      keyboard is sending or the display accepting. If the installed 
      termcap/terminfo is "better" than the one of the same name built into Vim you 
      can cure the problem by means of `:set nottybuiltin` — but more often the 
      $TERM environment variable is set to the name of a termcap/terminfo entry not 
      corresponding to the actual terminal in use and that's the culprit. Since I'm 
      on SuSE and not on gentoo I cannot tell which case applies here. — Tonymec

      Oh, another thing: it may be due to 'ttimeoutlen' being set to its default of 
      -1 which means that Vim won't see the difference between mappings and 
      multibyte keycodes. I recommend settings similar to > :set timeout 
      ttimeoutlen=100 timeoutlen=5000 < i.e., a 'ttimeoutlen' faster than you can 
      type (for keycodes) and a 'timeoutlen' slower than you will usually type (for 
      mappings). (Both timeouts are in milliseconds.) — Tonymec

      STOP PRESS — STOP PRESS — STOP PRESS —According to comments #17 to #19 in the 
      above-mentioned bug report [http://bugs.gentoo.org/212546#c17], "starting 
      gentoo xterm with -kt vt220 makes Vim happy". — Tonymec

    - I had a problem with broken keys when doing ssh on remote servers. None of 
      above tips helped me. But I figured out that doing: > :set nocompatible 
      <resolved my problem. Rafal Rusin

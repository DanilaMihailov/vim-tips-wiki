==============================================================================

By default, Vim on Windows uses the "Command Prompt" as its shell. If you 
have Cygwin installed (http://www.cygwin.com [http://www.cygwin.com]) you may 
want to use one of its shells instead, such as bash. This also makes all of 
the programs installed under Cygwin available for text processing.

To use Cygwin's bash as your default shell, add the following settings to 
your vimrc:

>
    " Makes bash open in the working directory
    let $CHERE_INVOKING=1
    
    " Default path for Cygwin 64-bit, change accordingly
    set shell=C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe
    
    " Without --login, Cygwin won't mount some directories such as /usr/bin/
    set shellcmdflag=--login\ -c
    
    " Default value is (, but bash needs "
    set shellxquote=\"
    
    " Paths will use / instead of \
    set shellslash
<

To use Syntastic you also need to set:

>
    " Syntastic uses PATH to determine available checkers
    let $PATH .= ';C:\cygwin64\bin'
<

The following settings may be included in a startup script to use bash as 
your shell. I have these commands in my gvimrc file in the installation 
directory.

>
    set shell=C:/cygwin/bin/bash
    set shellcmdflag=--login\ -c
    set shellxquote=\"
<

I had problems with parts of the /etc/profile not being executed, but I 
didn't want to add -i (interactive) to the shellcmdflag because this caused 
the shell to always open in my home directory. I prefer that it opens in the 
directory containing the file being edited. However, without that part of 
/etc/profile running, the path wasn't set up properly. To get around this, I 
added the following line to /etc/profile:

>
    RANPROFILE="TRUE"
<

I added this to my .bashrc:

>
    if [ -z "$RANPROFILE" ]; then
      PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"
    fi
<

Newer versions of the /etc/profile installed with Cygwin may behave 
differently.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-814-comments*

I found that

>
    set shellcmdlfag=--login -c
<

Didn't work too well for me, as every time I ran a shell command from gvim it 
would run it in my cygwin home directory rather than the directory associated 
with the current gvim buffer [That is what --login is supposed to do, if you 
don't want that, leave it off.].

So I replaced it with the following, I also had to add some cygwin bin 
directories to the path in my .bashrc file

>
    let &shell='C:/cygwin/bin/bash.exe' . ' --rcfile c:/cygwin/home/' . $USERNAME . '/.bashrc ' . '-i '
      set shellcmdflag=-c
      set shellxquote=\"

vimdiff (in gvim) doesn't seem to work with cygwin as default shell

==============================================================================

Go to cygwin setup, and install editors->vim,

It understands /cygdrive/c/ syntax, the regular Vim does not.

==============================================================================

I use Cygwin along with the Windows version gVim. It's true that this version 
of gVim doesn't understand the "cygdrive" syntax, so you have to use the 
cygpath command to convert your paths before it will work.

Here is a bash script I wrote that translates the paths and launches gvim as 
a background process. I added an alias to my .bash_profile so I generally 
forget it's there. There are probably better ways to do this, but it works for 
me:

>
    CMD="gvim"
    while [ -n "$1" ]; do
     if [ -n "`echo $1 | grep '^-'`" ]; then
      ARG=$1
     else
      ARG=`cygpath --absolute --windows "$1"`
     fi
     # Escape spaces in arg
     ARG=`echo $ARG | sed -e 's/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/g' -e 's/ /\\\\ /g'`
     CMD="$CMD $ARG"
     shift;
    done
    bash -c "$CMD" &
<

Some optimizations/improvments could be done in above script as follows (I am 
using cygwin 0.17-11):

1. enclose the arg in "" instead of using sed to replace \ to \\

2. use case..esac instead of if..else (grep '^-') to check first character of 
the arg

3. using eval instead of "bash -c"

4. remove --absolute from cygwin, otherwise current path gets added in 
non-path arg and error comes, e.g.

>
    keytool.exe -list -keystore myKeys -storepass myPass
<

becomes

>
    keytool.exe -list -keystore "D:\Siddhant\myKeys" -storepass "D:\Siddhant\myPass"
<

5. add "bg" option to run process in background

6. add usage option :-)

>
    #!/bin/bash
    
    if [[ $1 = "bg" ]];then
       BG="&"
       shift
    fi
    
    if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
       echo "usage: $0 [bg] <progarm> [args]"
       exit 0
    fi
    
    CMD="$1"
    shift
    
    while [ -n "$1" ]; do
       case "$1" in
         [+-]*) ARG=$1;;
         *) ARG=\"`cygpath -w "$1"`\";;
       esac
       CMD="$CMD $ARG";
       shift;
    done
    
    #echo $CMD $BG
    eval $CMD $BG
    </progarm>
<

Save the above in an script say win.sh and make aliases as follows

alias gvim='win.sh bg gvim'

alias java='win.sh java'

I gave a try to cyg-wrapper.sh on 
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Running_the_win32-version_of_Vim_from_cygwin 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Running_the_win32-version_of_Vim_from_cygwin] 
also but did not like much :-(

These mappings allow for opening explorer, windows command prompt, and cygwin 
bash in the directory of the current file.They should all work with 
directories that have evil spaces in them...

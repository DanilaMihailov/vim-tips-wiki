==============================================================================

Oracle's SQL*PLUS command line is very spare and simple, and an enjoyable 
challenge to use, but it does not keep a command history. VimTip41 |vwt-41| 
addresses this, but I could not get that to work for various reasons. I made a 
solution that is complicated in some ways (it requires a one-liner .bat file 
and a one-liner .sql file in addition to an entry in vimrc), but for me it was 
simpler in that I could get it to work in my situation.

I wanted a log (sqlplus.log) file of my previous sql commands, stored in my 
%SQLPATH% where my login.sql and other Oracle scripts live. I wanted to see 
that file even after I quit from the afiedt.buf (the default file created by 
Oracle upon executing the "edit" command in SQL*PLUS). This is the aspect of 
VimTip41 |vwt-41| that I could not get to work. Oracle requires that the 
process that creates that afiedt.buf return control back to Oracle (i.e. you 
must :wq from afiedit.buf). I would have liked a split window viewing both 
afiedit.buf and sqlplus.log, but have not been able to do that.

So I looked for a way to accomplish these three things:
    - Append the contents of afiedt.buf to a log file.
    - Keep the log file visible after :wq from afiedit.buf.
    - Pass the control back to Oracle properly so Oracle could see the contents of afiedt.buf.


While in SQL*PLUS, I enter

>
    @edit
<

at the command prompt to access this one-liner file named edit.sql placed in 
%SQLPATH% (where Oracle could always find it):

>
    --filename edit.sql
    host runvim
<

Upon reading this file, SQL*PLUS executes the command "runvim" from a newly 
made shell. Here is the file runvim.bat, placed in my %PATH%:

>
    :: filename runvim.bat
    START /B gvim %SQLPATH%sqlplus.history
<

This starts gvim without making a console window, opening the file 
"sqlplus.history" in the path %SQLPATH%, an Oracle environment variable set 
previously .

I edit my SQL commands from sqlplus.history, and copy-paste them to SQL*PLUS 
when I am done making typos. Or, I can invoke the SQL*PLUS command "edit" (as 
opposed to my "@edit" invocation which calls the edit.sql file). The "edit" 
command creates the afiedt.buf file. I want to append the contents of 
afiedit.buf onto sqlplus.history. I added this little function to my vimrc to 
do that:

>
    fu! Sqllog()
      1,$-1w! >> $SQLPATH/sqlplus.history
    endf
    au BufWrite afiedt.buf call Sqllog()
<

Also, I have this in my vimrc to ensure that Vim does not fork a new process; 
I believe it is necessary in using the builtin SQL*PLUS "edit" command:

>
    set guioptions +=f "so gvim does not fork new process
<

To Do: I would prefer to append the contents of afied.buf after it is quit 
from, instead of after it is written to, but I am not sure how to do that now. 
Also, the split window between sqlplus.log and afiedt.buf would be nice to 
have.

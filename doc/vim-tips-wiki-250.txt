==============================================================================

If you like to see your files in fullscreen, and you have to edit more files, 
you can do the following.
    - Use only one window 
    - Open further files with :e 
    - type :nm <A-Up> :bp!<CR> 
    - type :nm <A-Down> :bn!<CR> 
    - type :nm <C-F4> :bd!<CR> 


You can of course change the keys.

Now to switch between windows, you can press Alt-Up, and Alt-Down

(Just in the GUI, if you use console, don't use Alt key)

Another idea is to map them to Ctrl-Tab, and Ctrl-Shift-Tab

To close the current file you can press Ctrl-F4.

When I say type, I mean put it into your .vimrc of course

==============================================================================

Should the 'hidden' option be set for this to work?

==============================================================================

Consider using :bwipeout instead of :bd :help |:bd|.

==============================================================================

For some odd reason A-Up and A-Down was not working for me.I think C-Left and 
C-Right are also a nice combination

==============================================================================

Yes, all the Alt combinations are problematical and work only in the GUI.

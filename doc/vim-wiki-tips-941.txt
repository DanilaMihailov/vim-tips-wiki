==============================================================================

The MPI standard and the PVM library are commonly used to parallelize codes 
to run them across multiprocessor systems. The lines below can be added to the 
c.vim syntax file to highlight all MPI and PVM function calls, as well as the 
MPI data types. The Fortran syntax is the same except that PVM uses the pvmf 
prefix instead of pvm_. You will also need to add a line to your favorite 
colorization file to highlight the new Communicator group. I use a Yellow 
background which shows up well on both light and dark backgrounds to really 
illustrate where the communications calls are in a program.

>
    syn match cCommunicator "MPI_[A-Z][A-Z_a-z2 ]*("me=e-1
    syn match cCommunicator "MPIO_[A-Z][A-Z_a-z ]*("me=e-1
    syn match cCommunicator "pvm_[a-z ]*("me=e-1
    syn match cCommunicator "MP_[A-Z_a-z ]*("me=e-1
    
    syn keyword cType MPI_Group MPI_Status MPI_Request MPI_Win MPI_Aint
    syn keyword cType MPI_Info MPI_Op MPI_Datatype MPI_Comm
    
    HiLink cCommunicator Communicator

Example addition to the colorization file for dark backgrounds:

>
    hi Communicator guibg=yellow2 guifg=black gui=bold ctermbg=yellow ctermfg=black
<

Example addition to the colorization file for light backgrounds:

>
    hi Communicator guibg=yellow2 guifg=white gui=bold ctermbg=yellow ctermfg=white

I think the idea is great (I had just implemented my own syntax file to do 
the same), but part of the reason I want syntax highlighting is to catch 
typos, so if anything starting with MPI is highlighed, the mispelled ones will 
be highlighed also. It's not so bad to enumerate all 20 or so of the most 
common ones. I've enumerated a bunch of them

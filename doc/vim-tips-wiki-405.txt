I use [[ and its look-alikes a lot for browsing my C++ code. You can use 
ShowLine() and the following mapping to obtain something close to 
ShowBlockName (and it's pretty fast):

>
    map <silent> z[ [[k:call ShowLine()<CR>``
<

REFERENCES                                                *vtw-405-references*
    - :help |[[| 
    - :help |``|

ShowLine() is not built in to Vim.

Guessing from the vague original tip, I would say that this tip is meant to be a supplement to script#381 (ShowLine.vim).

<

EXECUTE COMMAND FROM BUFFER CONTENTS *vwt-305-execute-command-from-buffer-contents*

    yy@"     : same
<

GET OUTPUT FROM SHELL COMMANDS        *vwt-305-get-output-from-shell-commands*

These use external programs – `ls, grep, date, sort, …` (see :help |:sort| to 
learn how to use Vim's built-in sort).

>
    :r!ls                 : reads in output of ls (use dir on Windows)
    :r !grep "^ebay" file.txt  : read output of grep
    :20,25 !rot13        : rot13 lines 20 to 25
    :r!date              : insert date (use  date /T on Windows)
    :.!sh                : execute contents of current line in buffer and capture the output
    
     Sorting with external sort
    :%!sort -u           : contents of the current file is sorted and only unique lines are kept
    :'v,'w!sort          : sort from line marked v thru lines marked w
    :g/^$/;,/^$/-1!sort  : sort each block (note the crucial ;)
    
    !1} sort             : sorts paragraph; this is issued from normal mode!)
    
     Entering !! in normal mode is translated to  :.!
     Appending a command sends the current line to the command replacing it with command's result
    !!date              : Replace current line with date
    !!which command     : Replace current line with the absolute path to command
    !!tr -d AEIO        : translate current line deleting As, Es, Is, and Os from the current line
    
     You can also use ! on a visual selection. Select an area with one of the visualmode
     commands, and then type !command to pipe the whole selection through command.
    This is equivalent to :'<,'>!command.
    For example, after selecting multiple lines with visualmode:
    !sort              : sort selected lines
    !grep word         : keep only lines containing 'word' in the selected range.

LAUNCHING PROGRAMS UNDER WINDOWS    *vwt-305-launching-programs-under-windows*

There are a number of options to run applications on the Windows platform.

This causes Windows to launch the program associated with the file extension. 
It also restores the paste buffer to its original value:

>
    " This command will execute the file, for example, if this is an
    " HTML file, it will run:
    "     start c:\absolute\filename.html
    nnoremap <silent> <C-F6> :let old_reg=@"<CR>:let @"=substitute(expand("%:p"), "/", "\\", "g")<CR>:silent!!cmd /cstart <C-R><C-R>"<CR><CR>:let @"=old_reg<CR>
<

You can also use Windows rundll32.exe for some options:

>
    " vmap <silent> <C-F5> :<C-U>let old_reg=@"<CR>gvy:silent!!start rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler <C-R><C-R>"<CR><CR>:let @"=old_reg<CR>
<

Or, for example, you can launch Internet Explorer directly:

>
    :nmap <Leader>f :update<CR>:silent !start c:\progra~1\intern~1\iexplore.exe file://%:p<CR>
    :nmap <Leader>i :update<CR>:!start c:\progra~1\intern~1\iexplore.exe <cWORD><CR>

matches every line; the current line is copied into variable `x`; if any part 
of `x` matches (case sensitive) "green" and not "red" and not "pink", the line 
is deleted. Replace `#` with `?` for case insensitive.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-305-comments*

The Buffer Explorer scripts mentioned above (`\be` `\bs`) rely on the popular 
script bufexplorer.vim [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42].

Have recently started to appreciate taglist.vim (the most popular Vim script) 
it really comes into it's own with very long programs containting lots of 
subroutines/functions as it shows which function/sub you're in etc script#273 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273].

VIM TRAPS                                                  *vwt-305-vim-traps*

In regular expressions you must backslash `+` (match 1 or more).

>
    /fred\+/ : matches fred/freddy but not free
<

`\v` (very magic) reduces backslashing

>
    /codes\(\n\|\s\)*where : normal regexp
    /\vcodes(\n|\s)*where  : very magic

MORE, UNFORMATTED TIPS                        *vwt-305-more,-unformatted-tips*

TODO Might delete some of these if covered in other tips.

==============================================================================

Instead of this:

>
    :map <F12> :set number!<CR>
<

try this:

>
    map <F12> :set number!<Bar>set number?<CR>
<

and possibly these:

>
    map <F11> :set hls!<Bar>set hls?<CR>
    map <F10> :set paste!<Bar>set paste?<CR>
    map <F9>  :set wrap!<Bar>set wrap?<CR>
<

to easily change (and display) the current state.

==============================================================================

If you do not want to remove Windows key mappings, keep the line

>
    noremap <C-kPlus> <C-A>
<

in your vimrc. Then you can use Ctrl-NumPad+ to increment numbers as others 
do with Ctrl-A.

==============================================================================

Another very useful mapping:

>
    noremap <C-J> gj
    noremap <C-K> gk
<

That's really useful when dealing with long lines. It lets you use Control-J 
and Control-K to move up and down screen lines instead of buffer lines with j 
and k. Control-J isn't really mapped to anything by default, it's like hitting 
enter, but Control-K is something to do with digraphs. However, noremap won't 
remove this ability in insert mode.

Alternatively, you could use:

>
    noremap <Up> gk
    noremap <Down> gj
<

which would map the arrow keys to screen line movement instead of buffer line 
movement.

==============================================================================

To substitute any word (say FILE) by actual filename you can use

>
    :%s/FILE/\=expand("%:t")
<

==============================================================================

The mappings to wrap visual selections in text clobbers a buffer. I use:

>
    vmap s( <Esc>`>a)<Esc>`<i(<Esc> : wrap a visual selection in ()
<

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-305-comments*

What was the point of changing <Esc> into <esc> and <Tab> into <tab>? The 
capitalized form is what's used in Vim's help, and it's what should be used 
here. (Spiiph [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Spiiph] 03:34, December 6,

unfixed it. sorry. (perhaps this would have been better been placed in the discussion
Thanks for working on the tip. I might join in later. We put comments in plain view in the "Comments" section (so I removed the html comment) and we avoid the talk page (see the discussion guidelines for a little more). In due course we will delete these temporary comments, and what is on the talk page.
It's hard to know what to do with this tip. I think it should pretty well all be kept, but we should resist the temptation to expand it much (some better explanations are good). I'll think about how we might provide links to tips that expand some points, for example Tutorial. JohnBeckett 04:25, December 6, 2009 (UTC)

==============================================================================

Commands are case sensitive:

>
    c        : starts a change command
      C        : change to end of line (same as c$)
      ce       : change to end of word (a complete change command)
<

Does ce belong as an example of case sensitive command?Would better 
additional entry be

>
    a        : append after cursor
      A        : Append at end of line
<

Help for help

Is it me or does this section have a mix of syntax for control 
characters?DG12 [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:DG12] 13:51, December 6, 
2009 (UTC)

==============================================================================

My thoughts on comments by DG12 above and on my talk:
    - By "all be kept" above, I mean that the content is probably all good and 
      should not be removed (although there's a lot of it, and when I take some time 
      to look through it again I might change my mind). 
    - Re the format of the tip: The current plain text with just a ':' separating 
      command and text is a bit confusing in places, but the simplicity rather suits 
      Vim. I have used cleartable in a couple of tips, and I might try it here. See 
      VimTip605 |vwt-605| for an example. Wikitable is also available, but it's 
      rather overwhelming; see VimTip1611 |vwt-1611| for an example. 
    - Re the style of the tip: The quirky comments are often not directly helpful 
      but they worked well for me when I first read this tip (at vim.org) several 
      years ago. For example "`:set ignorecase : you nearly always want this`" 
      alerts readers that they should find out what the command means and consider 
      using it. If every point were clarified, the tip would be far too long and 
      hard to read. Currently the tip is useful because it provides a subjective 
      overview of what people should look for in Vim. 
    - Re the case sensitive point above: While a/A is a good example, it's not 
      needed as an additional example. I think the `ce` is to show a complete change 
      command. It might be a good idea to replace the c/C/ce with a/A which makes 
      the point. Actually, even better might be j/J because the two actions are 
      totally different. 
    - The "Help for help" section is perhaps confusing, but it is exactly correct 
      because it shows what a person should type. Like many of the items, it could 
      be improved while resisting the tempation to add too many words. 


Finally thanks for drawing attention to this page because the tip does need 
cleaning, and discussion and work will help. JohnBeckett

==============================================================================
    - re Help for help: I was refering to: 


>
    :h ctrl<C-D> : list help of all control keys
    :h CTRL-R    : normal mode
<

or maybe I am confused? (Be nice!)

I also think some people know the info so well what is unclear to someone 
reading the tip may not seem awkward at all.
    - re case sensitive example: I choose a/A because many (well some) of the 
      uppercase form of the command are like BIG versions of the lowercase version 
      w/W b/B h/H i/I ... 

    - re "quirky" comments: may mean something to look into but without a link its 
      not much help. 

    - Then there is the length of this document which makes scrolling difficult! 


DG12 [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:DG12] 01:58, December 7, 2009 (UTC)

It is impossible to learn everything about Vim in a short period. This tip is definitely quirky and subjective, however, many people (long before this wiki was created) have found the tip to be very helpful as a source of ideas rather than as a detailed manual. Perhaps the lead should make that clear, although it will be clear after reading for a minute or two. Yes, we should add links. The "help for help" should link to VimTip882 although that tip needs to be fixed! When I first read this page, I did not understand it either, but I referred to it many times while learning Vim.
The "help for help" stuff is correct, although unclear. The ":h ctrl<C-D>" item is saying to type :h ctrl then press Ctrl-D. The ":h CTRL-R" item is saying that the page of help will show you what Ctrl-R does in normal mode, whereas ":h i_CTRL-R" shows what Ctrl-R does in insert mode, etc. That should be explained at 882.

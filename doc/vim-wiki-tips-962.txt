Before using Vim, I used a nice little editor called Crimson. It had a nice 
backup feature that I used all the time. It could be set to automatically 
backup the current file whenever it was opened up. And all the backups would 
go to a dedicated backup directory. Furthermore, it kept the full directory 
structure.

Example:
    - I edit the file e:\project1\web\show_users.asp, when i open it up, a backup would be created at f:\vim_backups\E\project1\web\show_users.001

    - If I close my editor and re-open the file again in the afternoon, i would get another backup at f:\vim_backups\E\project1\web\show_users.002


This could lead to a huge number of files but it's easier to retrieve data 
that is there many times, than to retrieve data that does not exist anymore. 
Also, a simple zip takes care or any hard drive space issues. I have gone many 
times to that backup directory because my supervisor wanted the page to go 
back to what it was two days ago. It's been very useful.

In Vim, however, only 1 backup is created, and it's in the current directory. 
You can easily modify Vim to save all backups in a single directory, using the 
:set backupdir option but then you still only have the one latest backup. I 
created this short set of commands to make Vim have similar functionality as 
Crimson for backups (it uses date and time instead of numbers for the backup 
extension). It's the first version, so there might be some bugs, feel free to 
add/improve to your hearts content. Also, it's set up for Windows Vim right 
now, but it should be fairly easy to modify it for use on *nix machines.

Script explanation:

>
    step1:set variables
     this_root_backup_dir = the root directory where all backups will be saved
     this_dir = current directory of file you just opened
     this_filename = current filename of file you just opened
     this_drive = drive where the file you just opened is located (Windows)
     this_backup_dir_drive = drive that should exist in this_root_backup_dir
     this_backup_dir = full backup path starting from the root backup directory
    step2:check if the necessary drive letter exist in root backup directory, if not create it
    step3:check if the necessary directory exist in root backup directory, if not create it
    step4:set the new backupdir option for vim

I have these line in my vimrc file:

>
    "Incremental backups, will copy the backup file to a specific backup
    "directory and follow the tree structure of the file's directory
    "This allows for backup up from multiple drives (on Windows) and easy

    let g:this_root_backup_dir = 'f:\vim_backups'
    let g:this_dir = expand('%:p:h')
    let g:this_filename = expand('%')
    let g:this_drive = strpart(g:this_dir, 0, 1)
    let g:this_backup_dir_drive = g:this_root_backup_dir . '\' . g:this_drive
    let g:this_backup_dir = g:this_backup_dir_drive . '\' . strpart(g:this_dir, 3)
    "--make DRIVE directory if it doesn't exist
    if !filewritable(g:this_backup_dir_drive)
      silent execute expand('!mkdir ' . g:this_backup_dir_drive)
    endif
    "--make directory under DRIVE if it doesn't exist
    if !filewritable(g:this_backup_dir)
      silent execute expand('!mkdir ' . g:this_backup_dir)
    endif
    "--set new backup dir
    execute expand('set backupdir=' . g:this_backup_dir)

COMMENTS  *vwt-962-comments*

Found first bug: Error occurs when you open a file with a space in either the 
directory or the filename.

I fixed it with a substitute command, replacing all spaces with an 
underscore.

change

>
    :let this_dir=expand("%:p:h")
    :let this_filename=expand("%")
<

should become

>
    :let this_dir=substitute(expand("%:p:h")," ","_","g")
    :let this_filename=substitute(expand("%")," ","_","g")

See script#563 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=563] 
(rcsvers.vim [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Script:563]) for a way to use RCS do 
do this.

You really should use a version control system for this, like cvs or 
subversion. Then the text editor doesn't enter into it at all.

You could write very simple hooks to VIM that check in any changes 
automatically when you enter or exit the editor.

For Windows, try Subversion with TortoiseSVN: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ 
[http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/]

script#89 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=89] () is also 
pretty good.

==============================================================================

Vim provides tab pages as one way to organize your workspace, alongside (but 
not in place of) a buffer list and splittable windows. For basic tab use, see 
our Using tab pages [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Using_tab_pages]. Once you 
know how to navigate Vim's tab pages, you may be confused as to why they act 
so differently from the tabs in other editors. Here are some quick ideas, no 
scripts required, that can get you started using tab pages to their full 
potential.

FULL-PAGE REFERENCE DOCUMENTS         *vtw-1630-full-page-reference-documents*

By simply prefacing a `:help` command with the `:tab` modifier, you can have 
multiple full-page Vim help topics, each in its own conveniently-labeled tab 
page, without messing up your window layout. For example, instead of entering 
`:help toc`, type `:tab help toc`. If you have already opened a document in a 
window and would like it in a tab, press Ctrl-W then `T`.

You don't need to limit this to Vim's help. You can open other reference 
material (API docs, framework source code, project notes, etc.), each in a new 
tab for quick and easy access. This is useful when you need to refer to a 
document, but you do not want it taking up screen real estate next to the text 
you are currently working on.

QUICK CHANGES OUTSIDE NORMAL WORKFLOW *vtw-1630-quick-changes-outside-normal-workflow*

Tabs are great places to work on small tasks that fall outside your normal 
workflow. Open a new tab page for vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] 
changes or for scratchpads to hold external command output, chunks of text, 
etc., and you can very quickly switch back to what you were working on before, 
without messing up your window layout or anything else. Just close the tab, 
and you're automatically back to whatever you were working on.

ALTERNATE VIEWS OF A FILE                 *vtw-1630-alternate-views-of-a-file*

If you are working in a buffer with most folds open, you can keep a second 
tab page showing the buffer with all folds closed for an "at a glance 
summary". The folded version serves as an overview of the entire file, often 
visible on a single screen. You can take advantage of the "at a glance" view 
to rapidly find and mark a place in a file (typing `ma` creates a mark that 
applies to the buffer), then jump to the mark ('a) in a different tab showing 
the same buffer.

You can also go the other way. Instead of keeping a tab page for a 
"summarized" view, you could open a tab page for a detailed "x-ray" view of a 
buffer. In a separate tab page, you can enable useful but visually noisy 
options like 'list', 'cursorcolumn', 'cursorline', and 'number', and you may 
have several `:match` patterns active, or similar. This way, you can keep your 
regular working view clean and uncluttered, but quickly flip over to the 
information-overloaded version when needed. This idea works for the settings 
in :help |option-summary| that are labeled 'local to window'.

SEPARATE 'DIFF' VIEWS                         *vtw-1630-separate-'diff'-views*

Along the same lines as the "x-ray" tab above, you can take advantage of the 
fact that a 'diff' view of two or more buffers is local to the tab page. 
Knowing this, you can open up a new tab on the current buffer with `:tab 
split`, and then in the new tab use the |:DiffOrig| command to create a tab 
containing a diff of the current state of the buffer with the original state 
on disk. Now, you can go back to your original tab, make and even save 
changes, and your 'diff' tab will remain open for you to quickly see changes 
you have made since you started.

You can go further than this. Using tabs, you are not limited to a single 
diff. If you have two portions of a single file that are very similar, and you 
want to see exactly how similar, you can open a new tab with two new buffers, 
then copy and paste the two sections of the original buffer which you want to 
compare, one in each window. Then run `:windo diffthis` in the new tab and you 
have a quick comparison of just parts of the buffer.

You don't even need to close any other diffs you may have in progress to do 
this. Using tab pages, you can have multiple diff tabs open at once, alongside 
tabs for normal editing.

REDIRECTED COMMAND OUTPUT                 *vtw-1630-redirected-command-output*

Sometimes, you may want to use the output from an ex command, instead of just 
viewing it in the status area. Using the |:redir| command, you can run a 
command, capture the output, then open a new tab page to paste the captured 
text. This could also be done with a new window, or even within the current 
window, but using a new tab page can be less disruptive, as it will not mess 
up your current window layout or buffer contents. If you do this often enough, 
you could create a simple command or mapping.

You can do the same sort of thing with external commands. The method is even 
easier. Just open a new tab with `:tabnew`, then use the |:r!| command to read 
in the external command. If you find yourself doing this a lot, you can use a 
script [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Capture_ex_command_output].

MINI-SESSIONS                                         *vtw-1630-mini-sessions*

If you remove 'tabpages' from 'sessionoptions', then |:mksession| will only 
pay attention to the current tab page. This makes it easy to use tab pages as 
a lightweight project-organization tool–just open a set of files in whatever 
window layout you like, then run `:mksession some-project.vim` to save the 
current tab page as a session. To work on that set of files again, open a new 
tab page and :source the appropriate session file.

REPEAT A COMMAND ON A SELECTION OF BUFFERS *vtw-1630-repeat-a-command-on-a-selection-of-buffers*

It is easy to run a command on all files you have loaded (though not 
necessarily visible) in Vim, using |:bufdo|. It is possible, using |:argdo| to 
run a command on a selection of files. But, the argument list can be tedious 
to work with, and additionally it is limited to real files; you can't use it 
on buffers that don't yet or will never have an associated file. You can use a 
new tab to open a window on every buffer you wish to run a command on, then 
use |:windo| to run the command on every buffer in the tab. If you take care 
and pay attention to your buffer list instead of relying exclusively on tabs 
for your organization, you can even do something like:

>
    :tab sp
    :sball
<

to open a tab with a window for ALL currently loaded buffers, and then close 
any buffers you wish to exclude from your command. Then proceed with the 
`:windo` and close the tab to return to what you were doing before.

This method can be especially nice when working with the |quickfix| list, 
because you can use the 'switchbuf' option to automatically split a window for 
a result, and the |:cnfile| command repeatedly (potentially by using |@:| with 
a count) to open every file selected by your |:make|, |:grep|, or other 
command.

MORE IDEAS                                               *vtw-1630-more-ideas*

There are plenty more creative things you can do with Vim's tab pages. If you 
don't try to limit yourself to one-file-per-tab and one-tab-per-file, you will 
only be limited by our own imagination. Take a look at the other tips in the 
Tabs category [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Tabs] for more ideas and 
some helpful scripts.

When opening a file (in this example geocode.py) in Vim, I regularly 
encounter messages like:

>
    E325: ATTENTION
    Found a swap file by the name ".geocode.py.swp"
              owned by: rbronosky   dated: Fri Sep  7 17:17:37 2007
             file name: geocode.py
              modified: YES
             user name: rbronosky
            process ID: 6490
    While opening file "geocode.py"

    (1) Another program may be editing the same file.
        If this is the case, be careful not to end up with two
        different instances of the same file when making changes.
        Quit, or continue with caution.
    (2) An edit session for this file crashed.
        If this is the case, use ":recover" or "vim -r geocode.py"
        to recover the changes (see ":help recovery").
        If you did this already, delete the swap file ".geocode.py.swp"
        to avoid this message.
    Swap file ".geocode.py.swp" already exists!

This is the result of not properly closing an open buffer, usually because of 
a lost ssh connection. If there were unsaved changes, they can be recovered 
from this swap file. In order to know if this swap file is of value to me, I 
need to do some investigating. I have developed a system for resolving this 
quickly with as few keystrokes as possible.

The result will be a vertically split screen with the swap file on the left 
and the regular file on the right. You will be in diff mode and if the files 
are identical they will both be folded into one line.

Sure, this would make a good script, but I am a big fan of "learn to do it by 
hand". That way you can do it on any system, and you can use each of the 
little steps to aid your daily vimming.

If you want to know more about the commands used, use `:help`, for example:
    - :help |CTRL-W_l| 
    - :help |:diffthis|

LOSING SWAPFILES                                   *vtw-1517-losing-swapfiles*

After recovering a file from a swapfile and deleting the swapfile you will 
usually use swapname .swo (or similar). If something goes wrong again, vim 
will not detect the .swo swapfile on startup. It is useful to restart vim, or 
do the following trick:

>
    :set swf!|set swf!
<

In this way vim will delete the .swo swapfile and make a new one ending 
with.swp (you can check this with :swapname command). Now you are completely 
safe.



AUTOMATICALLY DELETING REDUNDANT SWAPFILES WITH A SHELLSCRIPT *vtw-1517-automatically-deleting-redundant-swapfiles-with-a-shellscript*

This is a useful trick, but it would be better if it was automated. Also in 
the situation where the recovered swapfile turns out to be identical to the 
real file, there is no need for the diffing. I use a shellscript to help deal 
with swapfiles, before starting Vim:

>
    # Expects variables realfile, swapfile, recoveryfile.
    vim -r "$swapfile" -c ":wq! $recoveryfile" && rm "$swapfile"
    if cmp "$recoveryfile" "$realfile"
    then rm "$recoveryfile"
    else vimdiff "$recoveryfile" "$realfile"
    fi
<



QUICK COMPARISON WITH A LITTLE PLUGIN *vtw-1517-quick-comparison-with-a-little-plugin*

Instead of steps 2-8 above, I do a quick comparison with:

2. `:DiffAgainstFileOnDisk`

And after that I do :e<Enter>d to delete the swapfile, or `:w!` to overwrite 
the file.

For this shortcut you will need a system with `diff`, and this script in 
`~/.vim/plugin/diff_against_file_on_disk.vim`

>
    command! DiffAgainstFileOnDisk call DiffAgainstFileOnDisk()
    
    function! DiffAgainstFileOnDisk()
      :w! /tmp/working_copy
      exec "!diff /tmp/working_copy %"
    endfunction
<

I have created a modified version of this function using vimdiff and 
shortened the command to DiffSwap to be handier:

>
    command! DiffSwap call DiffAgainstFileOnDisk()
    function! DiffAgainstFileOnDisk()
      :diffthis
      :vsp %
      :diffthis
    endfunction
<

When the swap prompt comes and you're not sure what to do, simply hit `r` and 
then run `:DiffSwap`, which will initiate a vim diff of the file on disk and 
swapfile.

FEATURE REQUEST                                     *vtw-1517-feature-request*

For goodness sake, if the swapfile is identical to the file on disk, then Vim 
should just automatically drop it for us, and not give us a prompt at all...



BASH FUNCTION TO HELP HANDLE SWAP FILES *vtw-1517-bash-function-to-help-handle-swap-files*

I sometimes get lots of swap files when my laptop loses power whlie vim is 
open. Using the above tips I created a bash function to help. It checks to see 
if the swap file is being used by an active vim process and if it isn't, it 
recovers the swap file into a recovery file (leaving the original file in 
place). It then compares the original file against recovered file; if they are 
identical it automatically removes the recovered file and swap file. If the 
recovered file and original file aren't the same, but the original file is 
newer than the swap file it asks if the user if they want to just delete the 
recovered file, or if they want to view a diff. If the swap file is newer than 
the original file and the recovered file is different than the original file, 
then vimdiff is opened so you can move any differences into the original file. 
When vimdiff is exited the function cleans up the old swap file and recovered 
file.

Usage is simple: `vim-process-swap file [swapfile [recoverfile]]` swapfile 
and recoverfile are optional.

If you are using the function in a loop over swap files, you can use the 
script like so: `vim-process-swap -s $swapfile` and you won't need to pass the 
real filename. Note that when using the -s flag that it isn't possible to 
specify a recoveryfile name or location.

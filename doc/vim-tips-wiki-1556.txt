USING MAPS IN VIM PLUGINS AND SCRIPTS *vtw-1556-using-maps-in-vim-plugins-and-scripts*

A Vim plugin or script can define new key maps to let the user invoke the 
commands and functions provided by the plugin. A Vim plugin can also invoke 
key maps defined by other Vim plugins.

A plugin can choose to map any available key. But to avoid surprising 
(annoying) the user, it is better not to use the keys that already have 
pre-defined functionality in Vim.

In a Vim plugin, the ":normal" command is used to execute normal mode 
commands. For example, the "gqip" normal mode command is used to format a 
paragraph. To invoke this command from a Vim plugin, the following line can be 
used:

>
    normal gqip
<

If any of the keys in "gqip" is mapped, then the mapped key sequence will be 
executed. This may change the expected behavior of the "gqip" command. To 
avoid this, add the "!" suffix to the "normal" command:

>
    normal! gqip
<

With the "!" suffix, the "normal" command executes the built-in functionality 
provided by Vim for the specified sequence of keys.

To invoke a script local function, defined with the "s:" prefix, from a map, 
you have to prefix the function name with <SID>. You cannot use the "s:" 
prefix for the script-local function, as the map will be invoked from outside 
of the script context.

>
    :inoremap <expr> <C-U> <SID>InsertFunc()
<

A plugin may map one or more keys to easily invoke the functionality provided 
by the plugin. In the plugin functions used by these types of maps, it is 
advisable not to alter user Vim option settings, register contents and marks. 
Otherwise, the user will be surprised to see that some options are changed 
after invoking a plugin provided map.

MAP LEADER                                               *vtw-1556-map-leader*

If the key maps provided by all the Vim plugins start with a same key, then 
it is easier for a user to distinguish between their own key maps and the ones 
provided by plugins. To facilitate this, Vim provides a special keyword that 
can be used in a map command.

If the {lhs} key sequence of a map command starts with the string "<Leader>", 
then Vim replaces it with the key set in the 'mapleader' variable. The default 
setting for the 'mapleader' variable is backslash ('\'). Note that 'mapleader' 
is a Vim variable and not a Vim option. The value of this variable can be 
changed using the 'let' command. For example, to set it to '_' (underscore), 
you can use the following command in your vimrc file:

>
    let mapleader = "_"
<

Vim replaces <Leader> with the 'mapleader' value only when defining the map 
and not when the map is invoked. This means that after several map commands 
are defined if the 'mapleader' variable is changed, it will not affect the 
previously defined maps.

For example, consider the following map command defined by a plugin:

>
    nnoremap <Leader>f :call <SID>JumpToFile()<CR>
<

When defining the above command, Vim replaces <Leader> with the value of the 
'mapleader' variable. If the user didn't set the 'mapleader' variable then the 
above map can be invoked by entering \f. If the user sets the 'mapleader' to a 
comma (','), then it can be invoked using ,f.

The <Leader> prefix should be used for global mappings (applicable to all 
buffers) defined by a plugin. For buffer-local mappings, the <LocalLeader> 
prefix should be used. Vim will replace this with the value set in the 
'maplocalleader' variable. The default value for this variable is backslash 
('\'). The <LocalLeader> is generally used in mappings defined by a Vim 
filetype plugin.

The 'mapleader' and 'maplocalleader' variables allow the user to choose 
different keys as starting keys for global mappings and buffer-local mappings 
defined by Vim plugins.

SCRIPT MAPS                                             *vtw-1556-script-maps*

If you want to use recursive maps in your map command, but want to use only 
those keys mapped in your script or plugin, then you can use the <script> 
attribute in the map definition. For example, consider the following two map 
commands in a script file:

>
    noremap <SID>(FindTopic) /Topic<CR>
    nmap <script> ,dt <SID>(FindTopic)dd
<

Within the second map command, only the '<SID>(FindTopic)' part is remapped. 
Without '<script>', 'dd' could be remapped too if someone defined a mapping 
for it.

If you use the <script> attribute with a ":noremap" command, then the 
<script> attribute overrides the ":noremap" command. The {rhs} of the map is 
still scanned for script-local key mappings. But the maps defined outside of 
the script are not used.

UNIQUE MAPS                                             *vtw-1556-unique-maps*

If you want to make sure that the mapped key is unique and doesn't interfere 
with other existing mappings, use the <unique> map attribute. This attribute 
is particularly useful with the maps defined by a Vim plugin. A map definition 
with the <unique> attribute will fail if the specified key is already mapped.

>
    :nnoremap <unique> \s :set invhlsearch<CR>
<

The above command will fail, if the user already has a mapping for the "\s" 
key sequence.

USE OF <PLUG>                                         *vtw-1556-use-of-<plug>*

If you are developing a Vim plugin or script and you want to provide the user 
with the flexibility of assigning their own key map to invoke a function 
provided by your script, then you can prefix the map with <Plug>.

For example, let us say a plugin has a function s:VimScriptFn() and the user 
has to create a map to assign a key to invoke this function. The plugin can 
provide the following map to simplify this:

>
    noremap <unique> <Plug>ScriptFunc :call <SID>VimScriptFn()<CR>
<

Note that in the above map command, instead of the typical key sequence for 
the {lhs} of the map, the <Plug>ScriptFunc text is used. The <Plug> generates 
a unique key sequence that a user cannot enter from a keyboard. The above map 
is visible outside of the script where it is defined.

With the above command, the user can assign _p to invoke the script function 
as shown below:

>
    :nmap _p <Plug>ScriptFunc
<



MAP RELATED FUNCTIONS                         *vtw-1556-map-related-functions*

Vim provides built-in functions to check whether a key sequence is mapped or 
notand to get the mapped key sequence.

MAPARG()                                                   *vtw-1556-maparg()*

To get the {rhs} of a map command from a script or plugin, use the maparg() 
function. For example, consider the following commands:

>
    :nnoremap <C-F2> 2<C-G>
    :let x = maparg("<C-F2>", "n")
    :echo x
<

The variable 'x' will be set to the mapped key sequence "2<C-G>".

The first argument to the maparg() function specifies the key sequence and 
the second argument specifies the editing mode. The maparg() function checks 
whether the specified key sequence is mapped in the specified mode and returns 
the {rhs} of the map if it is defined. If the mode is not specified, then the 
maparg() function checks for the map in the normal, visual and operator 
pending modes.

The maparg() function can be used to chain map commands. For example, let us 
say you want to define a map for <Tab>. But at the same time you don't want to 
lose the existing map (if any) for <Tab>. Then you can do the following:

>
    :exe 'nnoremap <Tab> ==' . maparg('<Tab>', 'n')
<

The above command maps <Tab> to invoke the == command and then invoke the 
existing map for <Tab> in normal mode.

MAPCHECK()                                               *vtw-1556-mapcheck()*

To check whether a map is defined for a key sequence, you can use the 
mapcheck() function. Example:

>
    :echo mapcheck(';g', 'n')
<

MODE()                                                       *vtw-1556-mode()*

In a map command, you can use the mode() Vim function to get the current 
editing mode. But this function returns 'n' (normal) or 'c (command-line) in 
most cases. So this function cannot be used reliably from a map command to get 
the current mode. Instead, you should pass the current mode as an argument to 
the called function. For example, if you want to use a Vim function Somefunc() 
in several mode-specific map commands and want to distinguish between the 
modes in the function, then you can do the following:

>
    :nnoremap _g :call Somefunc('n')<CR>
    :inoremap _g <C-O>:call Somefunc('i')<CR>
    :vnoremap _g :<C-U>call Somefunc('v')<CR>
<

HASMAPTO()                                               *vtw-1556-hasmapto()*

To check whether a map is defined for a particular key sequence, you can use 
the hasmapto() function. Note that this function checks for the key sequence 
in the {rhs} of a map. Example:

>
    if !hasmapto(":grep")
        " Define a mapping to invoke the :grep command
    endif
<

The hasmapto() function checks for the specified key sequence anywhere in the 
{rhs} of a map (not necessarily at the beginning of the map).

The hasmapto() function also accepts an optional {mode} argument which allows 
you to check whether a map definition exists in a particular mode.

>
    if !hasmapto(":grep", 'n')
        " Define a normal mode map to invoke :grep
    endif
<

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1556-comments*

Great series, thanks! One question: Suppose I have a plugin that remaps <C-\> 
and another plugin that calls <C-\><C-o> to execute a normal mode command in 
an insert mode mapping. The latter plugin assumes that <C-\> has not been 
remapped. Is there a way to change the second plugin so that it works even if 
<C-\> is remapped?

noremap, nnoremap...

The feedkeys() function could be given a mention? The flags 'nt' seem to me a 
nice sane way to remap keys when swapping them, that (hopefully) won't cause 
too many unwanted side-effects.

==============================================================================

Question: Why does Vim's documentation (:help write-plugin) recommend one 
extra level of mapping? Under the recommended approach, <Plug>ScriptFunc would 
be mapped to a script-local map sequence such as <SID>Func, which in turn, 
would be mapped to <SID>VimScriptFn()<CR>. It's not clear to me what advantage 
is provided by the extra level of indirection. I've asked on the Vim list, but 
am still awaiting a response...

I don't know. I saw your question there too and couldn't answer it. vim_use is the place to ask, you could try bumping your question. Or go ask on stack overflow or the Vim/Vi stack exchange. Either way inserting text into the middle of a wiki article isn't an effective way to ask even if this wiki was more active. I've moved your question to the comments section in case you get an answer and want to post it back here at some point. --Fritzophrenic (talk)

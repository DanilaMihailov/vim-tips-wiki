==============================================================================

Sometimes when a user is spell checking a long document they may 
inadvertently mark a word as correct and jump to the next word using the `]s` 
command. If the user had not jumped to the next word, they would be able to 
issue the `zug` command to mark the word as 'not found'. But, when a user has 
already moved to the next word, they must first move back in the jump list to 
the word they inadvertently marked as 'correct' using the `Ctrl-O` command. 
Then the user can issue the `zug` command, marking the word as 'not found' 
before continuing forward.

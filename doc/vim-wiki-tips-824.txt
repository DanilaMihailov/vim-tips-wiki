I want to change the font when Vim is launched in vimdiff mode, since you'll 
not be able to change the font later while retaining the 1:1 split, (in other 
cases, I can change the font before :diffs).

Just add something like the following in gvimrc. Of course, your fonts may 
vary.

>
    " Font must be set in gvimrc
    let in_diff_mode = 0
    windo let in_diff_mode = in_diff_mode + &l:diff
    set guifont=Lucida_Console:h15:cDEFAULT
    " In diff mode
    if in_diff_mode == 1
      set guifont=isi_ansi:h14:cDEFAULT
    endif
    unlet in_diff_mode
<

    "Here are some settings for diff mode, the colors are troublesome.
    if &diff
      set diffopt=filler,iwhite,icase,context:6
      ":windo! set wrap
      " hi diffchange ctermbg=0 .. is black on unix
      hi diffchange term=NONE ctermbg=3 ctermfg=5
      hi diffdelete term=NONE ctermbg=0
      hi diffadd term=NONE ctermbg=1 ctermfg=15
      if $TERM =~ "xterm"
        hi diffchange ctermbg=8 ctermfg=1
        hi difftext ctermbg=8 ctermfg=7
        hi diffadd ctermbg=8 ctermfg=11
      endif
    endif

Is there any reason not to test for the value of &l:diff directly? In my 
gvimrc the following lines seem to work:

>
    if &l:diff
      set guifont=Monaco:h9
    else
      set guifont=Monaco:h11
    endif
<

I have been looking for information on how to set the font size to much 
larger on a MacOSX installation of Vim.app.

This worked finally:

set guifont=Monaco:h18

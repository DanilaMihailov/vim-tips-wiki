==============================================================================

You might want to search for the current word in another window, without 
changing the view shown by the current window. Enter the following then press 
\w (assuming the default backslash leader key). That will split the window, 
then search for the current word in the other window. Press n for the next 
match, or N for the previous match. When finished, press Ctrl-w c to close the 
window.

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>w :let @/=expand("<cword>")<Bar>split<Bar>normal n<CR>
    :nnoremap <Leader>W :let @/='\<'.expand("<cword>").'\>'<Bar>split<Bar>normal n<CR>
<

If the cursor is on "rain", pressing \w will find "rain" and "drain" and 
"rainbow". However, pressing \W will find "rain" only.

Alternatively, if you are already showing two windows on the same file (that 
is, you have used :split), then the following map will search for the current 
word in the other window. Press Ctrl-w w to return to the original window.

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>w :let @/=expand("<cword>")<Bar>wincmd w<Bar>normal n<CR>
<

You can also use marks to return to where you started the search:

>
    ``   Returns to where you started the last search.
    `.   Returns to where you last made an edit.
<

Or just set a mark (press mm), do the search, then return to the mark by 
pressing `m

Is this in some way better than CTRL-W * and CTRL-W # mappings in our short 
mappings [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Short_mappings_for_common_tasks#Search]

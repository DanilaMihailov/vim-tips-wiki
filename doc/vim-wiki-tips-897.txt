==============================================================================

I use the following mappings to save my document -- they do away with the 
need for hitting escape when I'm in visual or insert modes.

>
    nmap <c-s> :w<CR>
    vmap <c-s> <Esc><c-s>
    imap <c-s> <Esc><c-s>
<

However, control-s will freeze some computers; if that happens, hit control-q 
to get out it.

In most Unixes you can disable control-S by doing this:

>
    /bin/stty stop undef
<

The F2 series of mappings are different; they only write if needed 
(performing an update) and return you to where you were: insert mode, visual 
selection etc.

>
    nmap <F2> :update<CR>
    vmap <F2> <Esc><F2>gv
    imap <F2> <c-o><F2>
<

So, if you're done with a particular operation, hit control-s (or whatever 
you come up with as a replacement); if you're not done, but want to save (just 
to be safe), use the F2 series of mappings.

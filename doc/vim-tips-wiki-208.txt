If you use the buffers menu, here is where you can change how the buffernames 
are displayed:

>
    menu.vim, function s:BMMunge
    OLD: let name2 = name2 . ' (' . a:bnum . ')'
    displays:
     .vimrc (1)
     menu.vim (2)
    
    NEW: let name2 = '&' . a:bnum . '. ' . name2
    displays
     1. .vimrc
     2. menu.vim
        (with the 1 and the 2 underlined)
<

which is more useful, because you can (almost) always pick the buffer you 
want with one keystroke, the buffernumber, until you get to buffer 10 anyway.

Great tip. I changed it so that if you have more than 9 buffers, you get the 
numbers for 1-9, and for the others you can type the first letter of the 
filename (which still may not be unique, of course, in which case it will take 
more keystrokes to select it).

>
    if a:bnum >= 10
    let name2 = name2 . ' (' . a:bnum . ')'
    else
    let name2 = '&' . a:bnum . '. ' . name2
    endif

This tip didn't work in the vim 6.2 menu.vim. Someone added this line a 
couple of lines down (line 702):

>
    let name = substitute(name, "&", "&&", "g")
<

so to make this tip work again, comment out this line.

You're a newbie in Vim and need some :help |help.txt|? Well, help.txt reads:

>
    Jump to a subject: Position the cursor on a tag between |bars| and hit CTRL-].
<

Unfortunately there is no "]" key on German keyboards. On Win32 try CTRL-+ 
(Strg-+), on Linux console I use CTRL-AltGr-9 (Strg-AltGr-9). On UNIX-like OS 
CTRL-5 works, too.

If you know the ascii code of the ] (93 or 0x5d), you could create a mapping 
to it to guarantee your combination would work -- the German keyboard might 
have some other character that could be used:

>
    noremap <c-theChar> <c-]>
<

You can get the ] by typing a control-v followed by 93<Space> or control-v 
followed by x5d.

==============================================================================

I suggest to use:

>
    nnoremap t <C-]>
<

the t functionality is rarly used and it make sense. (t =tag, and jumping 
back with control-t)

==============================================================================

I prefer this mapping:

>
    nnoremap ü <C-]>
    nnoremap Ü <C-O>
<

Who needs umlauts in normal mode?

==============================================================================

On the German keyboard, using anything with an umlaut (or, except on de-CH 
keyboards where it isn't present, ß which has no "standard" Vim binding 
either) makes sense in Normal mode. Similarly, on other national layouts, you 
may want to use a key for an accented letter, or in general for any non-ASCII 
character — if you have one. OTOH, on any keyboard layout, Vim reserves most F 
keys for "user mappings", with one notable (and traditional) exception which 
is F1 = Help, so one possibility suggests itself, valid for national keyboard 
(except maybe on some laptops where F keys are hard to get at), as follows:

>
    map <S-F1> <C-]>
<

If you don't like using F-keys with a modifier, you could e.g. use F2 
instead.

About the t (movement "till") key: the more I use Vim and the more I use it. 
A year ago I didn't even know that the function existed. Now I would need to 
assign it to the {rhs} of a new mapping if it were unavailable. In general it 
is dangerous in Vim to "steal" existing keys for a different purpose: the main 
argument against the mswin.vim plugin is precisely that it steals quite useful 
keys to remap already-existing functions to them. --Tonymec

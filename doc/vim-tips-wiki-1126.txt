==============================================================================

The screen's title can automatically be updated to the name of the currently 
opened file, or whatever you like.

Just add the following to your vimrc:

>
    let &titlestring = hostname() . "[vim(" . expand("%:t") . ")]"
    if &term == "screen"
      set t_ts=^[k
      set t_fs=^[\
    endif
    if &term == "screen" || &term == "xterm"
      set title
    endif
<

To create ^[, which is escape, you need to enter CTRL+V <Esc>

This will make a title like hostname[vim(filename)], but that's only my 
personal preference. That way, you can easily keep track on which window in 
your screen you have which file opened.

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1126-comments*

AUTOCMD                                                     *vtw-1126-autocmd*

Just found this on a website. Using:

>
    autocmd BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname() . "[vim(" . expand("%:t") . ")]"
<

instead of statically setting titlestring even updates the title when 
switching buffers/opening other files in the same vim session.

==============================================================================

I use:

>
    set titlestring=%t%(\ %M%)%(\ (%{expand(\"%:p:h\")})%)%(\ %a%)\ -\ %{v:servername}
<

By placing the expand expression inside a %{} pair, it is reevaluated 
automatically and doesn't require an autocommand around it.

THANKS FOR FLYING VIM                         *vtw-1126-thanks-for-flying-vim*

I tried it, and after editing a mail within mutt, the screen title keeps 
saying 'Thanks for flying Vim' instead of being reset to 'mutt'. Any ideas to 
fix this?



==============================================================================

I use this to avoid "Thanks for flying Vim"

>
    set t_ts=^[k
            set t_fs=^[\
            auto BufEnter * :set title | let &titlestring = 'v:' . expand('%')
            auto VimLeave * :set t_ts=^[k^[\
<

==============================================================================

Oh this is really a problem with all apps that fork off Vim. You can hack 
around this in mutt using

>
    source "~/.mutt/editorrc.$TERM"
<

in your muttrc and create a config for each terminal type, e.g. 
editorrc.screen:

>
    set editor="sh -c 'vim $0 && echo -ne \"\\033kmutt\\033\\134\"' "
<

This will reset the title to mutt after leaving Vim. The problem with this is 
that you need an extra file for each terminal type you use, lots of the 
probably containing only set editor=vim

I don't know if there's a possibility to have mutt ignore silently if a 
sourced file does not exist in which case you could set editor to a default 
value and override it only for some special terminal types.

btw, since we left the Vim scope now anyway, here's the rest of my title 
configuring stuff

my .bashrc contains

>
    case $TERM in
     xterm*|rxvt*)
     PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}[`basename ${PWD}`]\007"'
     ;;
     screen*)
     PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033k\033\134\033k${HOSTNAME}[`basename ${PWD}`]\033\134"'
     ;;
     *)
     ;;
    esac
<

and my .screenrc contains

>
    shelltitle '] |bash'
<

This will have the shell display hostname[last component of directory] 
whenever no program is running and enable screens heuristic to display the 
program name whenever a program is running.

The fallback value bash is almost never displayed since it will be overriden 
by the shell prompt. For shells other than bash you should be able to 
configure this in a similar way. (there are examples in the screen manual). 
The characters in shelltitle before the pipe sign need to fit the end of your 
shell prompt, which is "] " in my case.

ESCAPING SPECIAL CHARACTERS             *vtw-1126-escaping-special-characters*

File names can contain characters such as escape, which is very badly handled 
by my Vim. (The title gets printed, garbled, and doesn't end up in the 
titlebar properly).This is my solution:

>
    let my_asciictrl = nr2char(127)
    let my_unisubst = "␡"
    for i in range(1, 31)
      let my_asciictrl .= nr2char(i)
      let my_unisubst  .= nr2char(0x2400 + i, 1)
    endfor
    augroup termTitle
      au!
      autocmd BufEnter * let &titlestring = "vim " . tr(expand("%:t"), my_asciictrl, my_unisubst)
      autocmd BufEnter * set title
    augroup END
<

==============================================================================

You can use the Visual Incrementing script 
[http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VISINCR] to convert a block of 
numbers selected via Ctrl-v (visual block) into a column of increasing 
integers. Select the column then enter :I to replace the selection. The first 
line's number is used as a starting value, and the number in each subsequent 
line is incremented by one.

If the Ctrl-v block is "ragged right", which can happen when "$" is used to 
select the right hand side, the block will have spaces appended as needed to 
straighten it out. If the strlen of the count exceeds the visual-block 
allotment of spaces, then additional spaces will be inserted.

Example: Put cursor on topmost zero, select column with Ctrl-v, then enter :I

>
    vector[0] = 1;       vector[0] = 1;
    vector[0] = 1;       vector[1] = 1;
    vector[0] = 1;  -->  vector[2] = 1;
    vector[0] = 1;       vector[3] = 1;
    vector[0] = 1;       vector[4] = 1;

COMMENTS  *vwt-150-comments*

The vis.vim script at Visual Block Commands 
[http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VIS] can apply a substitute to 
a visual-block.

==============================================================================

visincr.vim supports:

>
    :I<CR>    will use the first line's number as a starting point, incrementing by 1
    :I #<CR>  like :I, but will increment by given number; negative numbers work fine
    :II<CR>   will pad on left as needed, otherwise like :I
    :II #<CR> like :II, but will increment by given number

==============================================================================

An additional script, calutil.vim, adds some calendrical date to/from Julian 
day conversion functions. With those, visincr.vim now has new commands:
    - IMDY [incr] : make a column of month/day/year dates
    - IYMD [incr] : make a column of year/month/day dates
    - IDMY [incr] : make a column of day/month/year dates
    - ID [incr] : make a column of day names


The optional incr (default value is 1) can be positive or negative. Both 
scripts are available at Vim Functions 
[http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VimFuncs].

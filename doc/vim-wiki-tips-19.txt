==============================================================================

It is sometimes useful to display line numbers in the left margin, for 
reference. Or to display current line/column in the status line, `set ruler` 
in your ~/.vimrc file.

ENABLING LEFT-MARGIN DISPLAY  *vwt-19-enabling-left-margin-display*

To display line numbers:

>
    :set number
<

or:

>
    :set nu
<

DISABLING  *vwt-19-disabling*

This will turn off the line number display:

>
    :set nonumber
<

or:

>
    :set nonu
<

The following command is useful because it toggles the display of line 
numbers. Assuming no numbers are currently displayed, this command will 
display them. Entering the command again will hide them.

>
    :set nu!
<

MAPPING TO TOGGLE LINE NUMBERS  *vwt-19-mapping-to-toggle-line-numbers*

You can also define a mapping to toggle the option, for example:

>
    :nmap <C-N><C-N> :set invnumber<CR>
<

By pressing Ctrl-N twice in normal mode, Vim toggles between showing and 
hiding line numbers.

If you want to be able to toggle line numbers both in normal and insert mode, 
you can define these two mappings (in this example, they're bound to the F3 
key):

>
    noremap <F3> :set invnumber<CR>
    inoremap <F3> <C-O>:set invnumber<CR>
<

ENABLING LINE NUMBERS ON STARTUP  *vwt-19-enabling-line-numbers-on-startup*

To enable line numbers on startup, simply add the following to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc].

>
    set number
<

ADDING LINE NUMBERS ONLY TO CERTAIN FILES  *vwt-19-adding-line-numbers-only-to-certain-files*

Create a filetype plugin for each filetype where you'd like to have numbering 
enabled (see :help |ftplugin-overrule|) and add the following line:

>
    setl number
<

CHANGING GUTTER COLUMN WIDTH  *vwt-19-changing-gutter-column-width*

If you have Vim version 7 or greater, you can change the width of the 
"gutter" column used for numbering:

>
    :set numberwidth=3
<

You can use the number column for the text of wrapped lines:

>
    :set cpoptions+=n
<

Finally, you can change the color used for the line numbers. For example:

>
    :highlight LineNr term=bold cterm=NONE ctermfg=DarkGrey ctermbg=NONE gui=NONE guifg=DarkGrey guibg=NONE
<

RELATIVE LINE NUMBERS  *vwt-19-relative-line-numbers*

For some commands, it is easier to know how many lines a given bit of text 
is, relative to the current cursor position. For example, moving with j and k 
with a count like 5j; or deleting 8 lines with 8dd can be easier if you have 
an at-a-glance view of distance from the cursor line instead of distance from 
the top of the file as with :set number.

To display line numbers relative to the line with the cursor, use:

>
    :set relativenumber
<

or

>
    :set norelativenumber
<

'relativenumber' is not a complete replacement for 'number'; rather, these 
two options interact so that you can show only relative numbers (number off 
and relativenumber on), only absolute line numbers (relativenumber off and 
number on), or show the absolute number on the cursor line and relative 
numbers everywhere else (both relativenumber and number on).

==============================================================================

If a user would like to paste text into a buffer and have that text indented 
properly so that the text matches surrounding indents, the following command 
can be given:

>
    ]p
<

Some users prefer to have all of their text pasted with indenting intact. In 
order to make this easier, the `]p` command can be mapped to the `p` command, 
so that whenever `p` is used, `]p` will be executed. The following can be 
added to the .vimrc to accomplish this:

>
    :nnoremap p ]p
    :nnoremap <c-p> p
<

This simply maps normal mode `p` to what `]p` normally does. While `ctrl+p` 
now performs just `p` without the indenting functionality.

CORRECTING BAD INDENT WHILE PASTING *vtw-272-correcting-bad-indent-while-pasting*

Unfortunately, the `]p` command will only adjust indent to match the current 
line, it will not re-indent the pasted text to correct it according to your 
current indent rules. You can do this as well, using the special mark, ``]`. 
This will jump to the last character of the paste, so you could change the p 
mapping above to:

>
    :nnoremap p p=`]
<

This takes advantage of the fact that a paste operation will place the cursor 
at the beginning of the inserted text, and uses the `=` operator to indent 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code] the entire inserted text.

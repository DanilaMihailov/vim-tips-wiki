==============================================================================

A number of scripts allow for text and code templates, even some which allow 
the user to put in placeholders. However, a script is not always needed to 
allow the user to quickly add a common code block or text block with place 
holding inserts. This template for inserts a code block with placeholders that 
are triple percent signs (%%%) where the user wants to enter custom text. The 
;; command is mapped to find the next %%% and allow the user to change them to 
the custom text.

CODE                                                            *vtw-322-code*

In this tips code block below, all template mappings are insert-mode only, 
while the "skip to next placeholder" (mapped as ;;) is both insert and normal 
mode enabled.

The following is an example code template for a "for loop" statement in C++ 
with 5 custom text input locations. When added to the vimrc file, it allows 
the user to type ";fo" in insert mode and add a "for loop" block into their 
code quickly.

>
    :imap <buffer> ;fo <C-O>mzfor( %%%; %%%; %%%)<CR>{ // %%%<CR>%%%<CR>}<CR><C-O>'z;;
<

Add the following to your vimrc file to add the "skip to next placeholder" 
functionality which will move the cursor to the next %%% section:

>
    :imap <buffer> ;; <C-O>/%%%<CR><C-O>c3l
    :nmap <buffer> ;; /%%%<CR>c3l
<

USAGE                                                          *vtw-322-usage*

Whenever a C++ for block is needed type ";fo" and the following code will be 
placed in the file. The "_" signifies where the cursor will be in insert mode.

>
    for( _; %%% ; %%%)
    { // %%%
     %%%
    }
<

The user may now type in some statement where the first "%%%" was, like i=0.

>
    for( i=0_; %%% ; %%%)
    { // %%%
     %%%
    }
<

The user would then type ;; to place the cursor at the next "%%%" location, 
removing the "%%%" and putting Vim into insert mode.

>
    for( i=0; _ ; %%%)
    { // %%%
     %%%
    }
<

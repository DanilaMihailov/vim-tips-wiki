==============================================================================

Often search and replace [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace] is 
needed in multiple files. This tip uses the procedures from run a command in 
multiple buffers 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Run_a_command_in_multiple_buffers] to show how a 
substitute may be executed multiple times using :argdo (all files in argument 
list), or :bufdo (all buffers), or :tabdo (all tabs), :windo (all windows in 
the current tab), or :cdo (all files listed in the quickfix list).

ALL BUFFERS  *vwt-1512-all-buffers*

The following performs a search and replace in all buffers (all those listed 
with the :ls command):

>
    :bufdo %s/pattern/replace/ge | update
<

The command above uses :update to save each buffer, if it was changed. That 
is necessary because, by default, Vim will not switch away from a buffer if it 
has been changed.

One alternative is to set the 'autowriteall' option so changed buffers are 
automatically saved when required:

>
    :set autowriteall
    :bufdo %s/pattern/replace/ge
<

Another alternative is to set the 'hidden' option so buffers do not need to 
be saved, then use :wa to save all changes (only changed buffers are written):

>
    :set hidden
    :bufdo %s/pattern/replace/ge
    :wa
<

If you don't wish to save the results of your replacement, but want to review 
each changed buffer first, you can force the bufdo to continue without saving 
files with bufdo!:

>
    :bufdo! %s/pattern/replace/ge
< 

ALL WINDOWS  *vwt-1512-all-windows*

If you are not dealing with a lot of files, it can be useful to display each 
wanted file in its own window, then operate on each window. For example, after 
opening multiple files with a shell command like gvim *.c, you could choose 
which files you wanted to operate on like this:

ALL FILES IN A TREE  *vwt-1512-all-files-in-a-tree*

Suppose all *.cpp and *.h files in the current directory need to be changed 
(not subdirectories). One approach is to use the argument list (arglist):

A similar procedure can perform the same operation on all wanted files in the 
current directory, and in all subdirectories (or in any specified tree of 
directories):

In the above, a forward slash was used in **/*.cpp. That works on all systems 
(Unix and Windows). If wanted, a backslash can be used on Windows systems.

REPLACING CURRENT WORD  *vwt-1512-replacing-current-word*

A common requirement is to replace the word under the cursor in a number of 
files. Rather than automating the process, it is best to use Vim's procedures. 
For example:

In the above substitute command:
    - The search pattern is empty, so the last search is used. 
    - Type your replacement text instead of replace. If the text is similar to the 
      current word press Ctrl-R then Ctrl-W to insert that word into the command 
      line, then change it. 


Alternatively, you might try the following user command or mapping.

>
    " Search for current word and replace with given text for files in arglist.
    function! Replace(bang, replace)
      let flag = 'ge'
      if !a:bang
        let flag .= 'c'
      endif
      let search = '\<' . escape(expand('<cword>'), '/\.*$^~[') . '\>'
      let replace = escape(a:replace, '/\&~')
      execute 'argdo %s/' . search . '/' . replace . '/' . flag
    endfunction
    command! -nargs=1 -bang Replace :call Replace(<bang>0, <q-args>)
    nnoremap <Leader>r :call Replace(0, input('Replace '.expand('<cword>').' with: '))<CR>
<

For example:

Instead of the :Replace command, you could use the mapping. Move the cursor 
to the word that is to be replaced and press \r (backslash, assuming the 
default Leader key, then r).

In the function, any special characters in the search word are escaped for 
generality, although that is unlikely to be needed since a word will not 
contain special characters. If the cursor is on the word old_text, the search 
pattern will be \<old_text\> so that only instances of the whole word are 
found.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1512-comments*

Thank you so much. It was very very helpful and saved so much of my time.

Ditto! This is so much easier than using sed.

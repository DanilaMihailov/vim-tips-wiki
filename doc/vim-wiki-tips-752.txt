For quite a long time I was annoyed to not be able to use <C-Left> <C-Right> 
when selecting text in Vim. Actually thoses mappings were working but like the 
W and B keys instead of w and b. The following mappings correct this problem 
and make those bindings work like in Windows.

You may have to enable select-mode for this to work . I personnally source 
the $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.Vim script in my vimrc which make select mode behave 
like Windows. This script is available in the Windows distribution of Vim. On 
linux, you may simply put the following command in your vimrc: "behave mswin". 
This will make selection work like in Windows.

    vnoremap <C-S-Left> b
    nnoremap <C-S-Left> gh<C-O>b
    inoremap <C-S-Left> <C-\><C-O>gh<C-O>b

If you want more complete simulation of Windows selection mode try:

    set keymodel=startsel,stopsel

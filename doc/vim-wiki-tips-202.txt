==============================================================================

Don't know how people debug autocommands, but I just found out that you can 
debug (at least) those that result due to window close by just doing a debug 
quit, i.e.,

>
    :debug quit
<

Vim will let you step into the autocommands. Try it to believe.

COMMENTS  *vwt-202-comments*

While going through the help pages, I figured this feature is documented with 
the following example:

>
    :debug edit <file>
<

This should let you debug autocommands that get triggered by loading a new 
buffer.

==============================================================================

There's also the :verbose command, with which you can specify the verbosity 
level for one command only:

>
    :9verbose edit somefile.txt.gz
<

The verbose levels are documented in :help 'verbose'. The 'verbose' option 
variable sets verbosity permamently, not just for one command only.

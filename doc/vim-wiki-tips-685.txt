This comes in handy if you have the full path of a file in your clipboard, 
and want to find it in your current buffer.

Instead of using "/" to search, use "?" then paste. You don't need to escape 
the frontslashes, so no need to edit the pattern.

If you wish to search forward, just hit "/" and Enter.

If you want to use it again, use the "?" history, not the "/".

This works on command line also, eg:

>
    :g ?c:/tmp/x/y/z/? d
<

instead of

>
    :g /c:\/tmp\/x\/y\/z\// d
<

==============================================================================

Instead of '?' in line,

>
    :g ?c:/tmp/x/y/z/? d
<

You can using any character as long as it is not in the search string, e.g.

>
    :g -c:/tmp/x/y/z/- d
<

==============================================================================

And you can use different characters for 'g' and 's' parts of a replacement 
search, eg:

>
    :g#/tmp/#s//#tmp#/
<

==============================================================================

Here is a neat way to use document searching:

c/tmp

change to the first instance of tmp found; leaves you in insert mode.

==============================================================================

/!\ Searching with "?" mean you will have to escape the "?" character.

A real solution here would be a plus. Like : How to search with "/" or "?" 
without escaping anything (create commmand, install plugin etc).

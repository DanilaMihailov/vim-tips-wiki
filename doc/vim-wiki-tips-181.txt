==============================================================================

There has been a number of person (including) asking in the Vim list how to 
keep up with Bram's incredible bug correction and patch writing skills, but 
there is a great way to do this!

Use the cvs source which is available at 
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8 
[http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8] it is kept up to date and its a lot 
easier than applying all the patch in order.

*vim-wiki-tips-333.txt*   Syntax-based folding *vwt-333*



This tip is deprecated for the following reasons:

The c.vim and cpp.vim syntax files include fold information usable by setting 
foldmethod to "syntax". The java.vim syntax file currently does not define 
folds, but syntax folding is a much better way to do this and the user can 
easily add it in the after/syntax directory.Tip 333 [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Syntax-based_folding]   Previous |vwt-332| Next |vwt-334|

Here's a function to toggle the use of syntax-based folding for a c/c++/java 
file. It also handles folding markers.

    function! OutlineToggle()
      if (! exists ("b:outline_mode"))
        let b:outline_mode = 0
      endif
      if (b:outline_mode == 0)
        syn region myFold start="{" end="}" transparent fold
        syn sync fromstart
        set foldmethod=syntax
        silent! exec "%s/{{{/<<</"
        silent! exec "%s/}}}/>>>/"
        let b:outline_mode = 1
      else
        set foldmethod=marker
        silent! exec "%s/<<</{{{/"
        silent! exec "%s/>>>/}}}/"

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-333-comments*

It seems to me that the default folds set up by the C syntax file work great! 
Just setting foldmethod=syntax should do the trick. This allows folding of 
/*...*/ comments as well. Since it is built into the syntax file, the below is 
unnecessary, since it already applies all the right groups.

I'm not sure if Java and Cpp syntax files also do this or not, but I assume 
they do.

==============================================================================

The syn region myFold start="{" end="}" transparent fold method does not like 
to work when you have other syn groups for {,}. I found this annoying (as I 
like my colored braces) so I figured a pure marker method would work nearly as 
well, and it does, at least for my uses.

Experiment with the "matchgroup", "contains", "containedin", "keepline", and "extend" options to fix this. I'm sure there is a way to make it work the way you want it. Using syntax folding is certainly the way to go, since that's exactly what you're trying to do here, and you can define multiple fold groups (e.g., folding not only on {..}, but also /*...*/ and #if...#endif).

One way that does work with matchgroup is simply to create 
~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim and insert the following line:syntax region cBlock 
matchgroup=Operator start="{" end="}" 
contains=ALLBUT,cCurlyError,@cParenGroup,cErrInParen,cCppParen,cErrInBracket,cCppBracket,cCppString,@Spell 
foldThen you may proceed to set highlights on Operator as usual.

Hopefully everything works just did v0.03 and I have run out of time, enjoy!

The tip in the comment is great. As is the whole concept of easy folding.I 
popped this into my .vimrc:

>
    map <silent> <F12> :OUTLINE<CR>
<

This makes F12 switch in and out of outline (folded) mode. You could probably 
use autocommand to make the folding happen when you open something you want to 
fold.

==============================================================================

I wish I had same thing for comments /* */, but foldermarker does not support 
regular expression.How about adding alternative foldermarkers?So, we may 
write:

>
    set foldermarker1={,}
    set foldermarker2=/*,*/
<

To me it sounds like a cool feature.

Please, check more simple implementation and it works with mouse, I tried to 
reproduce Visual Studio C# editor :)It looks almost the same. This is optimum 
combination to work with Java files.

>
    set foldmarker={,}
    set foldmethod=marker
    set foldtext=substitute(getline(v:foldstart),'{.*','{...}',)

<

Copy and save this as outlinetoggle.vim in your Vim/vim63/plugins directory. 
To toggle folding, type :FOLD.Remember you can use :zE to expand all folds.

==============================================================================

It would be cool if there was some way of folding the previous line for those 
of us that write code like

>
    int function(....)
    {
      ....
    }
<

so that the function name was the folded highlight.

==============================================================================

you can always do

>
    set foldtext=v:folddashes.substitute(getline(v:foldstart-1),'/\\*\\\|\\*/\\\|{{{\\d\\=','','g')
<

to have the highlighting be the previous lines text.

==============================================================================

zo = Open a foldzc = Close a fold (The fold region must already exist)zfm = 
'zf' means to create a fold of movement 'm'

So, if i had a block of code:

>
    if( predicate )
    {
      someFunction();
    }
<

If you move the cursor to one of the curly braces, in command mode you type 
'zf%', then you will end up with a fold looking something like this:

>
    if( predicate )
    3 lines: {
<

The "3 lines: {" will be highlighted, indicating that you have created a 
fold. Also, "3 lines" tells you how many lines were folded.

==============================================================================

Just a note to all fold users,

>
    :set fmr={,}
    :set fdm=marker
<

Is a quick and easy way to allow folding of anything between angle brackets.

then zM closes all folds and zR opens them all, so I don't know why you need 
this elaborate solution.

==============================================================================

Since no one else has suggested it:za == toggle fold

I find it much easier to just always use 'za' to open/close folds and let vim 
figure out to open or close, rather than figuring out to use 'zc' or 'zo' on 
my own.

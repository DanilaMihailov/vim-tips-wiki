Here's another variation on swapping to a file in another instance of Vim.

In Vim 7, this is what the SwapExists event is for. I use Vim on Windows 
accessing files via a samba mount onto the development server, and rely on the 
file type association to start Vim, and typically have half a dozen Vim 
instances, fighting for space with terminal sessions and applications, and so 
the swap file warning is a nuisance. Cured with:

>
    function! AskVims()
      let full_name = escape(expand("<afile>:p"), ' ')
      for i in split(serverlist())
        if i != v:servername
          if remote_expr(i, 'bufexists("' . full_name . '")')
            echo 'found in ' . i
            call remote_foreground(i)
            call remote_expr(i, 'foreground()')
            let v:swapchoice = 'q'
            return
          endif
        endif
      endfor
      echo "not found"
      let v:swapchoice = ''
    endfunction
    auto SwapExists * call AskVims()

Vim 7's distribution contains a file in the runtime/macros directory called 
editExisting.vim that does this already.

You could just copy it into one of your plugin directories or create a small 
editExisting.vim in your plugin directory that does this:

>
    runtime! macros/editExisting.vim

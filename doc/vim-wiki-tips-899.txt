All of you should know the gu{motion} and gU{motion} commands used to convert 
a region to lower/upper case. This tip explains how to capitalize a region.

Similar to the gu/gU commands, here are some mappings for "gc" (c as in 
capitalize).

To capitalize the word "example" place the cursor over the word and type 
`gciw` (similar to `guiw`).

>
    Before: this is an example.
    After:  this is an Example.
<

To capitalize the whole line place the cursor somewhere on the line and 
either type gcgc or gcc (similar to gugu/guu).

>
    Before: this is an Example.
    After:  This is an example.
<

I defined some common mappings. Please feel free to add your own.

>
    gcw        - capitalize word (from cursor position to end of word)
    gcW        - capitalize WORD (from cursor position to end of WORD)
    gciw       - capitalize inner word (from start to end)
    gciW       - capitalize inner WORD (from start to end)
    gcis       - capitalize inner sentence
    gc$        - capitalize until end of line (from cursor postition)
    gcgc       - capitalize whole line (from start to end)
    gcc        - capitalize whole line
    {Visual}gc - capitalize highlighted text

Put the following lines into your vimrc file.

>
    if (&tildeop)
      nmap gcw guw~l
      nmap gcW guW~l
      nmap gciw guiw~l
      nmap gciW guiW~l
      nmap gcis guis~l
      nmap gc$ gu$~l
      nmap gcgc guu~l
      nmap gcc guu~l
      vmap gc gu~l
    else
      nmap gcw guw~h
      nmap gcW guW~h
      nmap gciw guiw~h
      nmap gciW guiW~h
      nmap gcis guis~h
      nmap gc$ gu$~h
      nmap gcgc guu~h
      nmap gcc guu~h
      vmap gc gu~h
    endif

Of course, there's the cream-capitalize script script#242 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=242].

==============================================================================

I would appreciate a mapping to capitalize a word in insert mode, after 
having typed half a word without having to change modes.

>
    exampl<~>e  to Example<cursor_insert_mode>
<

==============================================================================

>
    :imap <F8> <Esc>g~iwea
<

This command toggles the case of every character of a word in insert mode. 
Replace "~" with "U" for uppercase or "u" for lowercase change.

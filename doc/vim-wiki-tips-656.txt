==============================================================================

Recursive mappings are fun to learn and really handy when you want to do 
repetitive tasks. One way to do this is by recording a macro |vwt-144|, which 
can be done recursively 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Recursive_repeats_for_quick_editing_of_structured_text]. 
This is another way when you find that you are using the same editing pattern 
again and again. Recursion may seem a bit complicated at first but it is very 
intuitive once you get the hang of it. Here are two examples.

Suppose you have a file with the following contents:

>
    aaa.txt
    bbbbbb.txt
    ccc.txt
<

You want to change the file as follows:

>
    wc aaa.txt> aaa.log
    echo "HelloWorld"
    wc bbbbbb.txt > bbbbbb.log
    echo "HelloWorld"
    wc ccc.txt> ccc.log
    echo "HelloWorld"
<

A simple recursive mapping that will do the job is:

>
    :map z Iwc <Esc>lyawA><Esc>pa.log<CR>echo "HelloWorld"<Esc>jz
<

Now type z in the first line and everything else is magic.

Here is the breakup where {} contain the vim commands.

The recursion terminates when the j cannot take you one more line further. If 
you manually execute a command for one line, you will find it very intuitive 
to create recursive mappings.

Here is another example. Say you want to change:

>
    #define myid 199
    #define myid2 200
    #define myid3 201
<

to:

>
    #define myid 201
    #define myid2 202
    #define myid3 203
<

The simple mapping would be:

>
    :map z 2^Ajz
<

where ^A is CTRL_V+A

>How does one stop a recursion that starts with a search?

    :set nowrapscan

See the "References" section above.

The terminating condition for such a recursive mapping is that the search 
should not find anything. If the wrapscan is on, the search starts from the 
top of the document again. So setting wrapscan to off makes sure that the 
search has a terminating condition.

    nmap z /^\*\*\*\*\*<CR>k"Ay}3jz

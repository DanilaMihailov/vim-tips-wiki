==============================================================================

Here's a general tip that works for any version of vi, not just vim.

It's very common to need to comment out a range of lines, let's say in a 
shell script. One way to do this is to move to the first line and type: I# 
(insert #<Space> as the first non-blank character of the line)

Then use a series of: j. (moving down and repeat the previous command/change)

However, this is tedious; using j.j.j. ...

Another way is to determine the line numbers of the first and last line. You 
can use the :f ex command to display these; or you can temporarily use :set nu 
to enable "number mode" and :set nonu to disable when you're done.

Whatever method you use to find the line numbers they can be used as a range 
for a substitute command: :xx,yy s/^/# /

This is a bit tedious because you have to look up the numbers and re-type 
them.

So we want a method that is less repetitive than j.j.j. and involves less 
manual fussing with line numbers than the ex range/substitute command. The 
solution is as old as vi/ex itself though it's often overlooked.

Move to the first line and set a mark with: ma (where "a" is any letter you 
choose)

Move to the last line and issue the following ex command: :'a,. s/^/# /

This works on the range of lines between the mark (single quote, register 
letter) and the current line (.) substituting each beginning of line with the 
string "# " (octothorpe, space).

More elaborate sequences of pure old ex commands can also be used to create 
boxes around C/C++ blocks; but they are really horrid to type every time so 
they have to be mapped to some key sequence and entails consistently using the 
same register every time.

For example:

>
    map gC :'a,. s/^/ */^M:. s/\(.*\)/\1^V^V^M **************\//^M:'a s/\(.*\)/\/**************^V^V^M\1/^M
<

maps the sequence gC to a macro which wraps a block of text, from the current 
line back to the line marked by the "a" in a C style comment like:

>
    /************************
    *
    * ....
    * ....
    ************************/
<

The example is a little crude - it doesn't indent the comment block at all, 
for example; and it could use some extra blank lines. However, it illustrates 
the point of what we can do even with plain old vi/ex commands.

COMMENTS  *vwt-981-comments*

Yes, this was part of my original vi training, but I hadn't quite mastered it 
until setting marks had become a part of my repertoire. But once I was 
comfortable with setting marks, fixing indenting in Vim was a matter of 'a='b 
(for marks a and b). (Of course, this depends on having the correct a syntax 
file set, but this is usually automatically set.)

However, for short ranges of basic prefixing comments (# or //), I've come to 
be very fond of visual block mode and block insert. To do this, start visual 
block mode (usually with Ctrl-V), and adjust the selection with movement keys 
as needed. (Again, marks can be used.) Once the selections are made, start 
block insert with 'I' (or append with 'A'), and type the comment text. When 
you hit escape, comments will be added to all affect lines. Also, the visual 
selection can be recalled with gv. The substitute can also be used with a 
visual selection since the visual selection creates marks of its own (though I 
use this least often). {FYI: This requires the +visualextra feature which may 
or may not be compiled into your current Vim. See :version to check your list 
of available features.}

==============================================================================

I use a autocommand to load the appropriate mapping for each language to the 
same key, like this:

>
    filetype on
    augroup vimrc_filetype
     autocmd!
     autocmd FileType c call s:MyCSettings()
     ...
     autocmd FileType vim call s:MyVimSettings()
    augroup end
    
    " Clear all comment markers (one rule for all languages)
    map _ :s/^\/\/\\|^--\\|^> \\|^[#"%!;]//<CR>:nohlsearch<CR>
    
    function! s:MyCSettings()
      ...
      " Insert comments markers
      map - :s/^/\/\//<CR>:nohlsearch<CR>
    endfunction
    
    function! s:MyVimSettings()
      ...
      " Insert comments markers
      map - :s/^/\"/<CR>:nohlsearch<CR>
    endfunction
<

So then I can press the '-' key to comment a line and the '_' key to 
uncomment it.

==============================================================================

You can consider using the boxes utility from http://boxes.thomasjensen.com/ 
[http://boxes.thomasjensen.com/]

The idea is to filter a number of lines through the boxes command, and it 
will take care of commenting the lines in or out, depending on its arguments. 
Especially useful in combination with autocommands, but see boxes' 
Documentation under the Vim integration chapter.

Advantage: simplicity.Disadvantage: it's an external tool.

==============================================================================

A -VISUAL BLOCK- can also be used to comment out lines. Start by typing 
"Ctrl-V" and then highlight a strip downwards by hitting "down/j". After that, 
type capital "I" to insert for all highlighted lines. Type the comment, in 
this case "#<Space>". Then hit "Esc".

Works with vim.

==============================================================================

I have added the following lines to my vimrc. I have to select a block of 
text and right-click and then click on the appropriate sub-menu item.

>
    vmenu PopUp.Comments.AddSQLComments :s/^/--/<CR>
    vmenu PopUp.Comments.RemoveSQLComments :s/^--//<CR>
    vmenu PopUp.Comments.AddCStyleComments <Esc>`>a*/<Esc>`<i/*<Esc>
<

==============================================================================

I use something like this in my 'rc file.

>
    vmap ,; :s/^/;;;/<CR>:noh<CR>
    " visually select block of text to comment, in Lisp
<

Something like this works great for just selecting a bunch of text or even in 
lisp a block of code to comment out.

And the reverse use something like:

>
    vmap ,cl :s/^;;;//<CR>:noh<CR>
    " uncomment visually selected text
<

==============================================================================

Not really a VIM tip, but I find here-documents very useful in bash for 
commenting out large chunks of code. It's also easier to delete than if you 
insert comments (e.g. #) because you only have to delete two lines instead of 
a # on every line.In my example I redirect to : which means nothing is printed 
or executed. You can redirect to anything that supports reading stdin. The 
'<<-' is the redirect, and '-' makes it ignore tabs or spaces at the beginning 
of lines. ': <<- COMMENT' redirects everything from the next line up to 
'COMMENT' on the last line. The keyword can be almost anything.

Example bash code:

>
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "this will be echoed"
    
    : <<- COMMENT
    	echo "this will not be echoed"
    	echo "neither will this"
    	ls -d .[a-z]*
    	# You can even insert tabs and comments.
    	Or just write whatever
    COMMENT

==============================================================================

Sometimes you modify a file, for example from the `/etc` directory, then when 
you try to save the file, you get a permission-denied error. This tip presents 
some suggestions for using sudo from with Vim, so you can successfullly write 
the file with temporary privileges.

Of course, this tip has to be used with caution, as it gets you more power.

SUGGESTION 1                                            *vwt-975-suggestion-1*

If you find you do not have permission to perform `:w`, use the following:

>
    :w !sudo tee "%" > /dev/null
<

You can make a command so `:W` invokes sudo:

>
    command W w !sudo tee "%" > /dev/null
<

Or, if you know about the problem beforehand:

>
    sudoedit path_to_file
    sudo -e path_to_file
<

SUGGESTION 2                                            *vwt-975-suggestion-2*

The following function saves the current file to a temporary file, then 
copies the new file to replace the original. It preserves the modes of the 
original file, though it is being rewriten.

>
    function Suedit()
      let fname=tempname()
      exe 'w '.fname
      let owner=system('stat -c%U:%G '.expand("%"))
      let modes=system('stat -c%a '.expand("%"))
      exec '!sudo cp '.fname.' '.expand("%")
      exec '!sudo chmod '.modes." ".expand("%")
      exec '!sudo chown '.owner'" ".expand("%")
    endfunction
<

Warning There is no check for symlinks. A symlink would be removed and 
replaced by a file with the symlink's modes, which are 777.

SUGGESTION 3                                            *vwt-975-suggestion-3*

Here is a mapping to save to a `/tmp` file, then overwrite the working file.

>
    nnoremap <leader>es :w! /tmp/sudoSave \| let $fileToSave=expand('%') \| let $fileToSaveBackup=expand('%').'~' \| !sudo cp $fileToSave $fileToSaveBackup && sudo cp /tmp/sudoSave $fileToSave<CR><ESC>:e!<CR>
<

Warning This command will reload the file; you will lose the modifications 
history (undo will not work, although it does keep a backup).

Note that a backup is made, even when '`nobackup`' is set.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-975-comments*

Use script#729 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=729] which 
has had more testing or use script#2709 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2709] which is an improved 
version of the first plugin (since it is not developed any more).

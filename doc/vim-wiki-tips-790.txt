antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/ [http://www.winfield.demon.nl/]) is 
written by Adri van Os.

Windows version can be found at 
http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~markus/antiword/ 
[http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~markus/antiword/]

Download and install it (and put it in your path).

antiword takes an MS-Word filename from the command line and outputs it in 
text/plain. It does not take input from stdin.

To view MS-Word documents in Vim, add lines to your vimrc similar to:

>
    autocmd BufReadPre *.doc set ro
    autocmd BufReadPre *.doc set hlsearch!
    autocmd BufReadPost *.doc %!antiword "%"
<

Now you can do vim resume.doc to view a text version of your document 
(hitting Enter on .doc file in your .vimprojects list works too).

If you're on a Windows system, in Explorer, try -> selecting resume-1.1.doc 
and resume-1.2.doc -> right click -> "Diff with Vim".

You could probably also use this command to diff documents:

>
    vim -d resume-1.1.doc resume-1.2.doc
<

By the way, you get antiword as part of www.cygwin.com. Remember you cannot 
actually update the Word Doc.

==============================================================================

To get around adding antiword to your PATH and to prevent the dreaded 
"hit-enter" prompt, I added the following to my vimrc, I hope everything 
displays properly due to HTML escaping.

I keep a directory of Tools specific to Vim (ctags, cscope, grep) in a Tools 
directory under Vim.

>
    " If an environment variable has not already setup Antiword
    if !isdirectory(expand('$ANTIWORDHOME'))
      let $ANTIWORDHOME=expand('$VIM/Tools/antiword')
    endif
    " If the directory exists, create the autocommands
    if isdirectory(expand('$ANTIWORDHOME'))
      autocmd BufReadPre *.doc set ro
      autocmd BufReadPre *.doc set hlsearch!
      " This prevents the hit-enter prompt and allows me to operate
      " without anitword being in the system path
      exec 'autocmd BufReadPost *.doc silent %!'.expand($ANTIWORDHOME).'\antiword "%"'
    endif
    
    " Works like a charm
    gvim testdoc.doc
<

==============================================================================

catdoc does the same thing.

==============================================================================

I do not think including

>
    set hlsearch!
<

in the autocommand is a good idea. The end result is that the value of 
'hlsearch' will depend on what it was when the autocommand was triggered, and 
I think you will get different values if you open one or two .doc files with 
vim. If you want to set this option to a particular value when opening .doc 
files, usae either

>
    set hlsearch
<

or

>
    set nohlsearch
<

See :help |:set| and :help 'hlsearch'.

See VimTip1356 |vwt-1356| for the same thing for PDF files.

On Windows XP, I had to use single quotes around the '%' argument instead of 
double quotes. I was getting errors about opening a Windows tmp file (maybe 
related to the document's Word template). I also add the "silent" keyword so I 
don't have to hit return. I didn't use the function posted above. So my vimrc 
entry looks like:

>
    " View word documents in Vim (good for diff'ing).
    autocmd BufReadPre *.doc set ro
    autocmd BufReadPre *.doc set hlsearch
    autocmd BufReadPost *.doc silent %!/usr/bin/antiword '%'
<

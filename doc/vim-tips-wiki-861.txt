==============================================================================

It is possible to configure Windows systems so that Windows Explorer includes 
an "Edit with Vim" item on the right-click context menu (see here 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Adding_Vim_to_MS-Windows_File_Explorer_Menu]). 
This tip shows how to add an "Open Vim here" item when a directory is right 
clicked, on a 32-bit Windows system. When configured, you can use Windows 
Explorer to right click a directory, select "Open Vim here", then use the 
"Explore" mode of Vim to navigate the directory and edit any files it 
contains.

To do this, we will use the same registry location as used for Windows file 
associations [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Windows_file_associations] to create 
a specialized custom action available for Folders.WARNING: Editing your Windows registry may cause unintended side effects that render your system inoperable. Although this tip has worked in the past for some people, there is no guarantee that it will work for you. Use with caution, and at your own risk.

ORIGINAL TIP                                            *vtw-861-original-tip*

This command will open vim in Explore mode:



This command will open a new buffer with path set:





FROM 200911                                              *vtw-861-from-200911*

Find or create registry key `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\Open Vim 
here\command` and change the default value to (using the correct path for your 
system):

>
    "C:\\Program Files\\Vim\\vim72\\gvim.exe" "%1"
<

The "Open Vim here" is any text that will be shown on the context menu when a 
directory is right clicked in Windows Explorer.

The quotes in `"%1"` are required to work with a directory with a space in 
its name. Alternatively, just use `.` as shown above.

The following could be saved in a .reg file to be imported for a slightly 
different implementation to achieve the same result. Because this uses 
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER` the user does not need administrative privileges.

TO DO
    - Work out what the difference between the procedures is, and probably merge 
      them.

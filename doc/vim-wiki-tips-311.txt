==============================================================================

Occasionally, on Windows, I have files open in gvim, that the folder for that 
file is not open for browsing.

The easy way to browse a file's directory without leaving Vim, is to use one 
of the built-in Netrw commands to open the current file's directory:
    - :help |:Explore| 
    - :help |netrw-:Explore| 
    - :help |netrw-:Sexplore| 
    - :help |netrw-:Vexplore| 
    - :help |netrw-:Hexplore| 
    - :help |netrw-:Texplore| 


Netrw or some of its replacements (like NERDtree 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658]) also allow simply 
editing a directory name to bring up a directory browser, for example with 
`:new %:p:h`.

If you prefer the Windows Explorer GUI, this key map opens the folder that 
contains the currently open file, checking first to prevent trying to open the 
folder of an unnamed buffer.

>
    if has("win32")
      " Open the folder containing the currently open file. Escape properly for Windows cmd shell.
      nnoremap <silent> <C-F5> :if expand("%:p:h") != "" \| exec "!start explorer.exe" shellescape(expand("%:p:h")) \| endif<CR>
    endif
<

If you have Vim 7.4.191 or higher, the mapping can be shortened to:

>
    nnoremap <silent> <C-F5> :if expand("%:p:h") != "" \| exec "!start explorer.exe" expand("%:p:h:S") \| endif<CR>
<

Note, if you are using the 'shellslash' option, you will need to temporarily 
toggle it off in your mapping before using `shellescape()`.

If you prefer to use full Explorer windows (with folder pane etc), modify as 
follows:

>
    !start explorer.exe %:p:h,/e<CR>:endif<CR><CR>

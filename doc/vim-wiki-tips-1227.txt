If you have ever wanted to drop to a full shell in a window and do things 
like run ssh, full-color bash, you should check out Thomas Wana's Vim-Shell 
patch: http://www.wana.at/vimshell/ [http://www.wana.at/vimshell/]

It currently only works on text-mode Vim 7.0.

See :help |shell-window|. This feature, while available, is discouraged.

The ConqueShell [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2771] 
plugin provides an interactive shell in a buffer, without needing to patch 
Vim.

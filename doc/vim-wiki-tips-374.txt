==============================================================================

Here are some examples of filtering which show how to save output from Vim 
commands, or read text from a file, or send text to an external program while 
capturing the output from that program.

CAPTURING OUTPUT                                    *vwt-374-capturing-output*

Redirection can capture the output generated by Vim commands.

Redirection to clipboard register + (or use any other register a-z):

>
    :redir @+
    :history
    :g/fred/
      " any other commands
    :redir END
<

The output from the commands used is now in register + which might pasted 
into a new buffer, for example by entering :new then typing "+p to paste.

If wanted, you can temporarily turn off Vim's paging so there will be no 
"More" prompts, as shown in the following example which outputs to register A 
(so output is appended to register a):

>
    :redir @A
    :set nomore
    :echo 'History'
    :history
    :echo 'Scripts loaded'
    :scriptnames
    :set more
    :redir END
<

Redirection to a file:

>
    :redir > out.txt
    :registers
      " any other commands
    :redir END
<

The above writes to the new file out.txt. The command does nothing if that 
file already exists. To overwrite the file if it exists, use :redir! > 
out.txt. To create a new file or append to an existing file, use :redir >> 
out.txt.

Store glob results in register a:

>
    " Clear @a (register a) because need to use A to append.
    :let @a = ''
    " Append all lines containing 'fred' to register a.
    :g/fred/y A
    " Append to a file (must use >>).
    :'a,'b g/^Error/ .w >> errors.txt
<

The last command uses the :.w command which writes the current line (.) by 
appending it to file errors.txt.

PROCESSING INPUT                                    *vwt-374-processing-input*

Get output from external commands:

>
    :r !ls     " read output from running ls, after current line
    :0r !ls    " after line 0 (before first line)
    :-r !ls    " before current line ("-" is ".-1")
    :r !dir    " use 'dir' on Windows
<

Filter current file using an external command (these examples use sort, but 
Vim has a built-in :help |:sort| command which should be used to sort lines):

>
    :%!sort -u      " use an external program to sort all lines
    :'a,'b!sort -u  " same, for lines from mark a to mark b inclusive
<

The term "filter" means to replace lines with the result from running a 
program. The original lines are sent as stdin to the program, and are replaced 
with stdout from the program. You can also filter using motion commands or 
visual selection:

>
    !}sort          " sort from cursor to end of paragraph
    3!}sort         " same, 3 paragraphs
    3!!sort         " sort 3 lines
    V               " start visual selection of lines
    (move cursor)   " select some lines
    !sort           " sort the visually selected lines
<

SIMPLE FILTER EXAMPLE                          *vwt-374-simple-filter-example*

Following is a Python program to sort the words on each line of standard 
input (each line is separately sorted).

>
    # File sortwords.py
    from sys import stdin
    for line in stdin:
        print ' '.join(sorted(line.split()))
<

A file you are editing in Vim may include the following text:

>
    this is a line with some words
    words on each line will be sorted
    fried banana and cream
<

Use this procedure to filter the text:
    - Press V on the first line, then jj to select three lines. 
    - Type !python sortwords.py and press Enter. 


The lines are replaced with the result from running the program:

>
    a is line some this with words
    be each line on sorted will words
    and banana cream fried
<

REFERENCES                                                *vwt-374-references*
    - :help |filter| 
    - :help |:!| 


COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-374-comments*

The section about redirecting Vim commands has nothing to do at all with 
using filters, and neither does the stuff about :r !cmd. That plus the actual 
stuff about filters seems redundant with the content in

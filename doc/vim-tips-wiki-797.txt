==============================================================================

When you set `foldmethod` to something like `indent` or `syntax`, which 
defines folds as soon as you open the file, all folds are closed by default. 
If you set the `foldlevel` to a high setting, files are always loaded with 
opened folds. For example, you could put the settings below in your `vimrc`:

>
    set foldmethod=indent
    set foldlevel=20
<

This is not ideal, however, as the `foldlevel` option is local to the window, 
and additionally gets modified every time you use a command that adjusts the 
fold level, like `zm`, `zr`, and their friends.

A better method is to set the `foldlevel` whenever you load a buffer into a 
window. You could use autocommands for this, but there is a built-in option 
that does this for you automatically:

>
    set foldlevelstart=20
<

This is much closer to an optimal solution, but one problem remains: even 
with the `foldlevelstart` option, it will take several iterations of the `zm` 
command to hide any of a file if you have set the `foldlevel` high enough. To 
fix this, you need to use autocmds. For example, to open all folds for a list 
of file types, but only up to the maximum fold level so that `zm` and related 
commands work right away, you could do the following:

>
    " Note, perl automatically sets foldmethod in the syntax file
    autocmd Syntax c,cpp,vim,xml,html,xhtml setlocal foldmethod=syntax
    autocmd Syntax c,cpp,vim,xml,html,xhtml,perl normal zR
<

Tweak the event and filetypes matched to your liking.

You could use a combination of this method and the `foldlevelstart` option to 
get just enough fold levels open on certain filetypes, but default to having 
them all open for files which are not of one of your chosen types.

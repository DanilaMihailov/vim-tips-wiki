This tip shows some techniques for accessing information when editing a Perl 
program. See also Perldoc function and module keyboard mappings |vwt-614| 
(which should be merged to here).

OPEN A PERL MODULE  *vwt-461-open-a-perl-module*

You may want to open the source code of a system Perl module that's 
installed. Here's one way to do that:

>
    :e `perldoc -l Module::Name`
<

The following function will allow you to set your cursor over a Perl module 
name in the file that you are currently editing and type \pm to open the 
corresponding source file in a new buffer:

>
    nnoremap <Leader>pm :call LoadPerlModule()<CR>
    
    function! LoadPerlModule()
      execute 'e `perldoc -l ' . expand("<cWORD>") . '`'
    endfunction
<

VIEW PERLDOC INFORMATION  *vwt-461-view-perldoc-information*

If you use the K command in Perl files, it will try to invoke 'man' on Perl 
keywords/functions. But this does not make much sense. It is more useful to 
redirect K to use 'perldoc -f' in a Perl file. Add this to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    au FileType perl setlocal keywordprg=perldoc\ -T\ -f
<

and K will lookup Perl function names using 'perlfoc -f' for you.

TO DO
    - Cleanup this and VimTip614 |vwt-614|, and merge 614 to here.
    - Rename this tip.
    - I'm pretty sure all the autocmd suggestions are misguided (and should be deleted).
    - Instead, show how to use an after/ftplugin/perl.vim file.


The following have suggestions for working with K that may be helpful in this 
tip:
    - 506 Open Windows Help files on a specific topic |vwt-506|
    - 598 PHP online help |vwt-598|
    - 642 Use K to easily run a Windows program for the current word |vwt-642|
    - 826 PHP manual in Vim help format |vwt-826|
    - 1341 Power K |vwt-1341|
    - 1533 Vim Doclet |vwt-1533|


I had a quick try with the after file, but there is some weird stuff going on 
with iskeyword that I'd like to sort out before doing any further cleaning.

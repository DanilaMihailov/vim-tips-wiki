==============================================================================

For syntax highlighting there are two sets of default color maps: One for a 
light and another one for a dark background.

If you have a black background, use the following command to get a better 
color map for syntax highlighting:

>
    :set background=dark
<

For a detailed description of syntax highlighting refer to :help |syntax.txt|

I just checked this in 6.0 and you no longer have to turn syntax off and then 
back on.

==============================================================================

This function reverses background setting so you can quickly toggle between 
light and dark . I use it because I'm often changing my desktop background and 
use transparent terminals.

>
    :function! ReverseBackground()
    : let Mysyn=&syntax
    : if &bg=="light"
    : se bg=dark
    : else
    : se bg=light
    : endif
    : syn on
    : exe "set syntax=" . Mysyn
    ": echo "now syntax is "&syntax
    :endfunction
    :command! Invbg call ReverseBackground()
    :noremap <F11> :Invbg<CR>
<

==============================================================================

You may also need to change the highlighting to match the new background. 
Here's the same macro as before, but toggling the background colour of the 
window as well:

>
    :function! ReverseBackground()
    : let Mysyn=&syntax
    : if &bg=="light"
    : se bg=dark
    : highlight Normal guibg=black guifg=white
    : else
    : se bg=light
    : highlight Normal guibg=white guifg=black
    : endif
    : syn on
    : exe "set syntax=" . Mysyn
    ": echo "now syntax is "&syntax
    :endfunction
    :command! Invbg call ReverseBackground()
    :noremap <F11> :Invbg<CR>
<

==============================================================================

script#105 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=105]

==============================================================================

Just to say I use this line in my vimrc:

>
    map <F11> :let &background = ( &background == "dark"? "light" : "dark" )<CR>
<

That let's me switch backgrounds pretty quickly

==============================================================================

Tweaking the colours isn't too hard.

as root head over to /usr/share/vim/vim63/colors/ or where ever you're 
storing all the .vim definitions for the colorschemes. Then open the color 
scheme file you use most of the time and look for the line starting with 'hi 
Comment'.

If it's not in there (it wasn't in the evening.vim for me) just add it. then 
set ctermfg=<something> and guifg=<something> if you're using gvim.

eg: (my evening.vim file has the added line

>
    hi Comment ctermfg=DarkGrey guifg=DarkGrey
<

you can then do the same things for Constant and Identifier types. You'll 
notice what you're looking for in the syntax definition files. 
/usr/share/vim/vim63/syntax for me.

==============================================================================

To change the search highlighting I use:

>
    hi Search guibg=LightBlue
<

(also try LightGreen)

For my error message highlighting I use:

>
    highlight ErrorMsg guibg=White guifg=Red
<

==============================================================================

"hi Search guibg=LightBlue" is only for the GUI version of Vim. If you're 
using Vim in-console, try "hi Search ctermbg=LightBlue"

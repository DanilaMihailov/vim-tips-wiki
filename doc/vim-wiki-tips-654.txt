==============================================================================

Let's think about the code below.

>
    void
    howdy(void)
    {
      M00 =
      M01 =
      M10 =
      M11 =
      M20 =
      M21 = 0;
    }
<

Now you want to change the code like

>
    void
    howdy(void)
    {
      M[0][0] =
      M[0][1] =
      M[1][0] =
      M[1][1] =
      M[2][0] =
      M[2][1] = 0;
    }
<

You can easily do that with

>
    :g/\(M\)\([0-9]\)\([0-9]\)/s//\1[\2][\3]/g
<

Here, \1 is a special substitute character meaning first part of the search 
pattern.

To specify a part in your search pattern, simply enclose your search pattern 
with "\(" and "\)".

Thus, in the above example

>
    \(M\) corresponds to \1, and
    \([0-9]\) to \2 and etc...
<

And substitute pattern "\1[\2][\3]" means

>
    "1st part" + "[" + "2nd part" + "]" + "[" + "3rd part" + "]"
<

which is what we want here.

Why not

>
    %s/\(\d\)\(\d\)/[\1][\2]/
<

==============================================================================

This works too:

>
    %s/\v(\d)(\d)/[\1][\2]
<

When opening a number of files into buffers a user may want to switch quickly 
through the open buffers. The following methods will allow the user to map key 
combinations to buffers for easier access.

METHOD 1                                                    *vwt-967-method-1*

Use `Alt-X` to quickly switch between buffers, where X is the buffer number 1 
to 9.

In your .vimrc add:

>
    :map <M-1> :confirm :b1 <CR>
    :map <M-2> :confirm :b2 <CR>
    ...
    ...
    ...
    :map <M-9> :confirm :b9 <CR>
<

Note this is somewhat similar to the built-in |CTRL-^| command, which can 
take a count to jump to a specific buffer number.

METHOD 2                                                    *vwt-967-method-2*

Use <ALT><Left> and <ALT><Right> to cycle through buffers.

In your .vimrc add:

>
    " cycle through buffers with <ALT><Left> and <ALT><Right>
    :nmap <M-Left> :bprev<CR>
    :nmap <M-Right> :bnext<CR>
<

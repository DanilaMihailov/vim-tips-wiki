==============================================================================

Git [http://git-scm.com/] is a distributed version control system, which you 
can use directly from Vim with some help from plugins:
    - vim-fugitive [http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive] (status unknown). Help 
      text is provided. 
    - git-vim (included with Vim 7.1 and later). Provides ftplugin and syntax files 
      for editing various git files (e.g. commit messages). 
    - fastgit.vim [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2861] (not 
      updated since 2009). 
    - VCScommand [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90] plugin that 
      needs to be installed separately. This provides commands to interact with git. 
      Help text is provided. 
    - gitv [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3574] is a 'gitk 
      clone' plugin. 
    - vimagit [https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit] is an attempt to reproduce the 
      magnificent emacs Magit [https://github.com/magit/magit] plugin to vim. The 
      main idea is to manage all git operations in one single buffer, as efficiently 
      as possible. 
    - vim-gitgutter [https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter] plugin which shows 
      a "changed" indicator based on git diff in the gutter (sign column). It can 
      also stage or revert hunks. Also see the similar Signify 
      [https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify] plugin. 


Git supports using vim diff to resolve merge conflicts

>
    git mergetool -t vimdiff
<

To make it the default merge tool across all your repos

>
    git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
<

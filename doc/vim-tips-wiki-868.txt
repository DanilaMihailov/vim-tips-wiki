==============================================================================

Recently I found it very helpful to use the 'langmap' option. But I've got a 
problem: When I switch to my language, I'm not able to use the `$` command 
(go-to-end-of-line), because the keyboard layout for my language does not 
contain this character at all.

I had to press <End>, or use some other inconvenient way of jumping to the 
end of a line.

Today I found another way, which is much easier: command `g_` moves the 
cursor to the last non-blank character in the line. This works with 'langmap', 
for all English characters are always "mapped" properly.

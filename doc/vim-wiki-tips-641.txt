==============================================================================

When editing big cpp files, it can be very convenient to highlight the method 
name (the part after "::") in a method definition.

I use the following function in my vimrc:

>
    " Add highlighting for function definition in C++
    function! EnhanceCppSyntax()
      syn match cppFuncDef "::\~\?\zs\h\w*\ze([^)]*\()\s*\(const\)\?\)\?$"
      hi def link cppFuncDef Special
    endfunction
<

I have another line to call this function automatically when editing a C++ 
file:

>
    autocmd Syntax cpp call EnhanceCppSyntax()
<

This doesn't work in all cases (for instance, it doesn't highlight 
constructors using an initialization list on the same line) but it shouldn't 
highlight function calls (such as MyClass::MyStaticMethod( int foo ); )

To further facilitate adding user-defined extensions to existing syntax 
files, you can use a ".vim/after/syntax/" directory. See :help 
|mysyntaxfile-add|.

==============================================================================

Sometimes a basic feature of Vim does not work as expected. The following 
instructions can help eliminate possible sources of the problem.

GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING                     *vtw-1676-general-troubleshooting*

CHECK VIM WITHOUT CUSTOMIZATIONS   *vtw-1676-check-vim-without-customizations*

Run the following command from your terminal and see if the problem persists 
(if wanted, replace "`vim`" with "`gvim`"):

>
    vim -N -u NONE -i NONE
<

You will need to manually enable anything like filetype detection, syntax 
highlighting, etc. that are needed to troubleshoot the problem.
    - If the problem persists, that means the problem could be in the Vim 
      executable or official runtime files. Go and verify the enabled features 
      |vtw-1676-verify-required-features|. 
    - If the problem went away, it is time to test your vimrc 
      |vtw-1676-check-vim-with-just-your-.vimrc|. 


VERIFY REQUIRED FEATURES                   *vtw-1676-verify-required-features*

Check the feature you need was enabled when Vim was built. Use the `:version` 
command to see if that feature is enabled.
    - Some/any needed features are disabled. Build Vim with desired feature enabled 
      or use your package manager to install a Vim version that has them enabled. 
    - All needed features are enabled. Consider 3rd party libraries. For example, 
      the command-T plugin requires that your system ruby be the same as that which 
      was linked with Vim. 


CHECK VIM WITH JUST YOUR .VIMRC     *vtw-1676-check-vim-with-just-your-.vimrc*

Run Vim with following arguments and see if the problem disappears:

>
    vim -N --noplugin -i NONE
<
    - If the problem persists, the reason of your pain is inside your vimrc 
      |vtw-1676-vimrc|. 
    - If the problem went away, the next step is to rule out the plugins 
      |vtw-1676-check-vim-with-just-your-plugins|. 


CHECK VIM WITH JUST YOUR PLUGINS   *vtw-1676-check-vim-with-just-your-plugins*

Back to your terminal and run Vim like this:

>
    vim -N -u NORC -i NONE
<
    - If the problem persists, the issue is related to one or more plugins, find 
      out which |vtw-1676-plugins|. 
    - If the problem went away, maybe the problem is that Vim is running in 
      compatible mode, verify that with `:verbose set cp?` to also see where it is 
      being set. 


SPECIFIC TROUBLESHOOTING                   *vtw-1676-specific-troubleshooting*

PLUGINS                                                     *vtw-1676-plugins*

If you have no idea which plugin(s) might be causing the problem, use a 
binary search method to isolate the errant plugin(s).

VIMRC                                                         *vtw-1676-vimrc*

The VimLint [https://github.com/dahu/VimLint] plugin was designed to help 
identify erroneous vimrc settings.
    - Ensure you have a personal vimrc file (file `~/.vimrc` on Linux, or 
      `$HOME/_vimrc` on Windows). 
    - Ensure your vimrc contains at least: 


>
    set nocompatible
    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on
    set hidden
<
    - Ensure your vimrc does not have: 


>
    set compatible      or    set cp
    set smartindent     or    set si
    set cindent         or    set cin
    set lisp
    set gdefault        or    set gd
    set edcompatible    or    set ed
    set exrc            or    set ex
    set insertmode      or    set im
    set noloadplugins   or    set nolpl
    set nomagic
    set nomodeline      or    set noml
<
    - If Vim finds the command `finish` anywhere in your vimrc it will stop 
      sourcing the rest of the file. So you can use it to do a binary search as 
      described in Plugins |vtw-1676-plugins| to identify the problematic line. 
    - Ensure `:echo $SHELL` is correct. You will need to use a POSIX shell for full 
      Vim compatibility. The fish shell is known to not be compatible. 
    - Ensure `:echo $TERM` is correct. Check TermSettings for your terminal type. 


MAPPINGS                                                   *vtw-1676-mappings*

A custom mapping may not work because it was overwritten by a plugin. The 
following command will tell you if `aa` is mapped to something and, if so, 
where the mapping was created.

>
    :verbose map aa
<

Use the appropriate `:map` command for the mapping you are testing, see 
`:help :map-modes` for more details.

OPTIONS                                                     *vtw-1676-options*

Many plugins change options when they are sourced, filetype is set, etc. So, 
you might find yourself wondering why an option is not set as you expect. From 
inside Vim, type this command:

>
    :verbose set myoption?
<

That displays the value of the given option and where it was set. Replace 
`myoption` with the option being tested, and remember to include the "`?`" 
(the query causes the value to be displayed; omitting it might set the 
option).

For local options that inherit its value, that command would not specify 
where the value was set. What to do in this case?

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1676-comments*

Should explain the use of the `-i` flag, and also mention that the viminfo 
file can be the cause of issues (especially slowness in loading apparently).

==============================================================================

Also need to talk about how to get various plugin managers to start up 
without your .vimrc when doing -u NORC.

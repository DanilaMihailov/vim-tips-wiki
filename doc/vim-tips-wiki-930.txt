Many file types can be displayed with syntax highlighting. :help |syntax|

Vim provides a script that can create an html document (including the 
foreground and background colors, and syntax highlighting) from the current 
file, or from selected lines. :help |convert-to-HTML|

CREATING HTML                                          *vtw-930-creating-html*

In gvim, use "Convert to HTML" on the Syntax menu. A new file is created, 
containing the html equivalent of all text from the current buffer.

The same operation can be performed by entering a command:

>
    :TOhtml
<

If you visually select some lines before entering `:TOhtml`, only the 
selected lines will be converted.

If your color scheme uses a dark background, you may want to temporarily 
switch to a white background before creating the HTML document. Copy-paste of 
rich text from the browser into an email client or other application often 
discards the background color. One way to do that is to use the command:

>
    :colorscheme default
<

USING THE HTML                                        *vtw-930-using-the-html*

Of course the HTML file created by `:TOhtml` can be used on a web site. In 
addition, on some systems it may be useful to open the HTML file in a web 
browser for printing. On Windows, you can copy text from within Internet 
Explorer, and paste it into some other applications in RTF format.

CONFIGURING THE OUTPUT                        *vtw-930-configuring-the-output*

The :TOhtml command works by sourcing the $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/2html.vim 
script, which accepts several options to customize the output. You can ignore 
folding, add dynamic javascript-based folding to match your document in Vim, 
change the encoding used, and more. See :help |:TOhtml| for details. For some 
options such as dynamic folding and font settings, you may need to grab the 
latest version of the 2html.vim runtime file. Visit www.vim.org for details on 
updating all your runtime files [http://www.vim.org/runtime.php] or ftp 
mirrors [http://www.vim.org/mirrors.php] from which you can download 
individual files.

The latest version of :TOhtml will make standards-compliant code by default, 
but for Vim versions before 7.3, it is highly recommended to put `:let 
g:html_use_css = 1` into your .vimrc.

MODIFYING THE HTML                                *vtw-930-modifying-the-html*

If you want to paste the generated HTML code into a web forum, often you 
cannot also paste the CSS generated by default, or prefer not to. Old versions 
of :TOhtml generate with font tags and the like by default, but you can still 
use this old behavior in new versions with `:let g:html_use_css = 0` before 
generating code.

When using this option, the HTML generated by `:TOhtml` places the color of 
the background and default foreground into the tag <body>. If the code is 
pasted into an HTML-enabled web forum, those colors disappear.

This function solves the problem, by removing the HTML header and replacing 
the <body> tag with a <table> instead. This allows you to paste a valid 
(albeit deprecated) snippet of HTML into the forum with colors fully defined.

>
    function! MyToHtml(line1, line2)
      " make sure to generate in the correct format
      let old_css = 1
      if exists('g:html_use_css')
        let old_css = g:html_use_css
      endif
      let g:html_use_css = 0
    
      " generate and delete unneeded lines
      exec a:line1.','.a:line2.'TOhtml'
      %g/<body/normal k$dgg
    
      " convert body to a table
      %s/<body\s*\(bgcolor="[^"]*"\)\s*text=\("[^"]*"\)\s*>/<table \1 cellPadding=0><tr><td><font color=\2>/
      %s#</body>\(.\|\n\)*</html>#\='</font></td></tr></table>'#i
    
      " restore old setting
      let g:html_use_css = old_css
    endfunction
    command! -range=% MyToHtml :call MyToHtml(<line1>,<line2>)
<

Now you can select a range of lines, type `:MyToHtml` and use the result to 
post your code to an HTML-enabled web forum.

COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-930-comments*

There is a Perl module Text::VimColor 
[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::VimColor] that runs Vim to generate HTML 
or XML automatically. There are some usage notes 
[http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=314528].

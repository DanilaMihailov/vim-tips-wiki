One may overwrite a visual-block of text with another visual-block of text 
by:
    - Select the first block: `ctrl-v move "ay` 
    - Select the second block: ctrl-v move c ctrl-o "aP <Esc>

Based on the current tip, I've added a little extension to visswap.vim which 
allows one to
    - Select a region using Ctrl-v + motion (visual block). 
    - Press Escape. 
    - Move cursor to another location, hit \vr (the backslash is actually <Leader>, 
      so folks may customize that easily). 


That sequence will replace the text in a visual-block fashion below the 
cursor. One may repeat the `\vr` multiple times for additional replacements.

For visswap.vim, see Visual Mode Based Swapping 
[http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VISSWAP].

==============================================================================

To make second block exactly same size as first instead of <Ctrl-v> move hit 
1<Ctrv-V>

This will make a rectangular selection of exactly same size as previous one 
using current cursor position as top left corner. Unfortunately it does not 
(always? yet?) work with multibyte encodings, so be careful if you use them.

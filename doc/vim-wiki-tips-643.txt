==============================================================================

If there's a built-in key command in Vim that you find annoying, or that you 
often hit by accident, then you can disable the key by mapping it to nothing. 
For example:

>
    :map K <Nop>
<

For "<Nop>", type the five characters as they appear (less-than N o p 
greater-than).

Of course, you can always

>
    :unmap K
<

if you start doing C programming and want to instantly "man" things under the 
cursor again.

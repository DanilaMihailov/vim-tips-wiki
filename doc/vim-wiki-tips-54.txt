Do you wish you could view a Java Class File using Vim?

First of all you will need a Java Decompiler to decompile the Class File. I 
would suggest the JAD decompiler by Pavel Kouznetsov
    - http://www.varaneckas.com/jad [http://www.varaneckas.com/jad] 


It's a command line decompiler and absolutely free.

Next create a vimscript file called jad.vim:

>
    augr class
    au!
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class %!d:jad.exe -noctor -ff -i -p %
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class set readonly
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class set ft=java
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class normal gg=G
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class set nomodified
    augr END
<

Note: Keep the Jad.exe in a directory without white spaces. The -p options 
directs JAD to send the output to standard output instead of a .jad file. 
Other options are described on the JAD site.

Next add the following line in the vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] 
file.

>
    so jad.vim
<

Next time you do vim abc.class, you have the source code for abc.class.

NOTE: I have written the script so as to open the class file read only, So 
that you don't accidentally modify it. You can also extend this script to 
unjar a jar file and then view each file in the JAR file.

I modified this a little bit to use the improved file runtime organisation of 
vim60, I don't know if other will like it better but here it is:I added to 
filetype.vim:

>
    augroup filetypedetect
    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.jad setfiletype java
    au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.class setfiletype class
    augroup END
<

and created in ftplugin a class.vim with

>
    %!jad.exe -noctor -ff -i -p %
    set readonly
    set ft=java
    normal gg=G
    set nomodified
<

==============================================================================

If you don't want to 'hit ENTER' after every decompilation, you can add 
'silent' to some of the lines:

>
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class silent %!jad -noctor -ff -i -p %
<

and maybe even:

>
    au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class silent normal gg=G
<

==============================================================================

I can now select any class file, right click, and select the "Edit with Vim" 
option to view the source.

I'm just wondering, how do I change this to if I do the same to a jar file, 
and it will show me the contents of the jar file, as in a jar -tf, and if I 
select any of the entries, I can view the source?

I tried opening the jar file using WinZip, and if I view any of the entries 
in it using vim, I'll get something like this:JavaClassFileReadException: 
can't open input file on `C:\Documents'JavaClassFileReadException: can't open 
input file on `and'JavaClassFileReadException: can't open input file on 
`Settings\gwunwai\Local'JavaClassFileReadException: can't open input file on 
`Settings\Temp\Version.class'

I think that's because WinZip extracts the zip entries into my temp 
directory, which contains white spaces.

Is there some way around this?

==============================================================================

you can change the command to %!jad.exe -noctor -ff -i -p "%"(enclosed the % 
with quotes). It worked for me

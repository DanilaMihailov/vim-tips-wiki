==============================================================================

This mapping makes it much simpler to write new java classes by automating a 
repetitive coding task, the creation of setters and getters. Note that a 
ready-made plugin |vtw-288-plugins| exists to do much the same thing.

To use, first write a basic class with the following format:

>
    public class MyClass
    {
      private <type> <varname> = <initvalue>;
      private <type> <varname> = initvalue>;
      // getters
      // setters
    }
<

Note the getters/setters comment -- these are important as they are used to 
place the getters and setters.

The mapping is which should be added to the .vimrc file is:

>
    map jgs mawv/ <CR>"ty/ <CR>wvwh"ny/getters<CR>$a<CR><CR><Esc>xxapublic
    <Esc>"tpa<Esc>"npbiget<Esc>l~ea()<CR>{<CR><Tab>return
    <Esc>"npa;<CR>}<Esc>=<CR><Esc>/setters<CR>$a<CR><CR><Esc>xxapublic void
    <Esc>"npbiset<Esc>l~ea(<Esc>"tpa <Esc>"npa)<CR>{<CR><Tab>this.<Esc>"npa=
    <Esc>"npa;<CR>}<Esc>=<CR>`ak
<

The above should be one long line with no spaces between the end of the lines 
above.

To use this to generate a class go to the variable that should have a 
setter/getter and place the curser at the beginning of the 'private':

>
    private <type> <variable> = <initvalue>'
    ^
<

Then type:

>
    jgs
<

This will create the first getter/setter and then move up to the next 
variable. A user can continue typing `jgs` until all the getters/setters have 
been generated.

PLUGINS                                                      *vtw-288-plugins*
    - The java_getset.vim [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=490] 
      script makes it dead simple to auto generate getters and setters, plus its 
      easy to install and configure. 
    - lh-refactor [http://code.google.com/p/lh-vim/wiki/lhRefactor] handles getters 
      and setters among other refactorings (and languages) 


COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-288-comments*

This is a great idea, but this implementation is a little lacking. When I 
first used it, it put my getters and setters in comments (since it searchers 
for // getters, and doing an $a<CR> on that line continues the comment). 
Additionally, it assumes a tabstop of 8 instead of letting the file type 
indent do the work, plus the spacing is a little messed up.

What I usually do is type all my private members. I got to the first one and 
hit `qa` to start macro recording to register a. Then I make my getter and 
setter using only commands that operate on words and not characters. When 
done, hit `q` again, and now register a has your macro.

Comment from Jeremy; This mapping caused a delay on the last j press in 
normal mode for me. It was quite irritating. I would suggest pointing the 
mapping to a different key sequence where the first key is not a common 
navigation key.

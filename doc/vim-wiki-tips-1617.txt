==============================================================================

We often use :make to build my C++ project and then go through the compile 
errors and fix them. :help |quickfix|

This simple tip shows how you can use :make to use Quickfix with doxygen 
[http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/].

From the shell command line, generate a default config file:

>
    $doxygen -g
<

From within Vim do the following:

>
    :set makeprg=doxygen
    :make Doxyfile
<

Quickfix will then allow you to go through your doxygen errors as you would 
through gcc errors.

You might have noticed that gvim uses slightly different colors compared to 
the console version. If you like the console colors more than the gvim default 
colors (as I do), you can add the following to your vimrc:

>
    set background=dark
    hi SpecialKey guifg=Blue
    hi MoreMsg guifg=Green
    hi Visual guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
    hi Folded ctermbg=4 guibg=Blue
    hi FoldColumn ctermbg=7
    hi DiffAdd guibg=Blue
    hi DiffChange guibg=Magenta
    hi DiffDelete guibg=Cyan
    hi Normal guifg=Gray guibg=Black
    hi Cursor guibg=White
    hi lCursor guibg=White
    hi Comment guifg=Cyan
    hi Constant guifg=Magenta
    hi Special guifg=Red
    hi Identifier guifg=Cyan
    hi Statement guifg=Yellow
    hi PreProc guifg=Blue
    hi Type guifg=Green
    hi Underlined guifg=Blue
    hi Todo guifg=Black
<

There's one little difference: Folded is changed to something better for 
console *and* gui and FoldColumn is left as is in gvim and changed for console 
vim to match the gvim version.

For those of you who like the old school VGA console feel, heres a truetype 
version of the VGA font used by most graphics cards. Make sure you set it to 
be used at size 17 cos thats the only font size it will work at.

This should be distributed with vim among the other colorschemes. I think the 
only thing that is missing are the colors of the ruler (when switching 
colorschemes, the ruler's colors are not updated). Perhaps

>
    hi StatusLine guifg=black guibg=gray
<

should do the trick.

I think the line "hi Visual guifg=NONE guibg=NONE" was causing my VIM on XP 
to complain "Warning: terminal cannot highlight"

This changed from 6.2 to 7.0 (Highlighting a line worked in 6.2, it stopped 
working in 7.0)

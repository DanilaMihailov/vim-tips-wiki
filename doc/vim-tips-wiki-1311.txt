==============================================================================

If you're trying an install on a remote machine where you don't have root 
access, this can be very useful. But instead of using ROX?, all you need to do 
is set your VIM, VIMRUNTIME, and PATH environment variables after running 
`make`

Python omnicomplete requires Vim 7 compiled with a Python interpreter 
(`config --enable-pythoninterp`), but that makes the Vim executable about 
4.5MB larger. For normal text editing I don't need that extra baggage, so I 
use two different copies of Vim: one that's compiled with my normal options 
(no Python), and one that's compiled with Python. I use the ROX filer to 
launch normal text files with "vim" (my normal executable), and *.py files 
with "vimpy" (compiled with `--enable-pythoninterp`). This solution is optimal 
if you have hard drive space to spare, but no time to waste waiting for Vim to 
start. The following steps will give you my setup; they assume that you use 
the standard installation directory for Vim, but if you're changing that, you 
probably also know how to tweak my directions for your needs.

STEPS                                                         *vtw-1311-steps*

1. Download and install ROX filer (http://rox.sourceforge.net 
[http://rox.sourceforge.net]). Optional, but highly recommended; ROX is clean, 
powerful, and useful.

2. Download the Vim 7 sources (http://www.vim.org/download.php 
[http://www.vim.org/download.php]), extract and load up a terminal in the 
extracted directory.

3. Run `./configure` with the options that you want for your standard Vim 
install (but without `--enable-pythoninterp`), then "make" and "make install".

4. Run `./configure --enable-pythoninterp` and with any other options that 
you want for your Python editing Vim install, then "make" (but don't "make 
install" this time).

5. Do a "cd src" to get to where your newly-compiled version of Vim is, then 
do "sudo mv ./vim /usr/local/bin/vimpy" to name the python-enabled copy of Vim 
"vimpy" and move it to same directory as your normal Vim executable.

6. In ROX filer, right-click a Python code file and select "Set Run Action". 
Where it says "Enter a shell command", enter this text: `vimpy -g "$@" 
[OPTIONAL]`

7. Also in ROX, right-click a normal text file, and select "Set Run Action" 
again. This time go to the top where it has two radio buttons, and select the 
one that says "Set default for all 'text/<anything>'". Where it says "Enter a 
shell command", enter this text: `gvim "$@" [OPTIONAL]`

Now anytime that you launch a Python source file from ROX, a copy of gvim 
will start up that has Python support compiled in. Anytime you launch a text 
file from ROX that isn't a Python source file, you'll get a copy of gvim that 
doesn't have Python support compiled in (which should let it start up faster).

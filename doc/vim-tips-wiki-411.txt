==============================================================================

Plugins have three basic ways of being initialized:

a. Via some variable that the plugin script uses; the initialization here is 
obvious -- set the desired variables in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] (or use an appropriate autocmd to do so).

b. Via a map or function call. The problem here is that vimrc is sourced 
prior to plugin sourcing, so the map or function call isn't available yet.

c. Via a command. Like (b), the vimrc is sourced prior to the plugin being 
sourced, so the command isn't available yet.

==============================================================================

Solution 1: put in `.vim/after/plugin` a file of the same name as the plugin 
you're initializing. In that file put

>
    Maps         : norm TheInitializationMap
    Function call: call TheInitializationFunction()
    Command      : TheInitializationCommand
<

For example, the <`HiMtchBrkt.vim`> script which supports the highlighting of 
matching brackets as you move onto a bracket is not on by default. Normally it 
requires one to type `\[i` to start it. However, if you'd like to have the 
script to start enabled, then put

>
    norm \[i
<

into the file `.vim/after/plugin/HiMtchBrkt.vim`.

Windows users: Change .vim to _vimfiles and / to \ in the tip above.

[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User_talk:Ron1989]) 06:15, July 4, 2014 (UTC) The 
solution below is tested working on current version of vim(both 7.3 and 7.4).

Solution 2: for users reluctant to separate plugin initialization from file` 
~/.vimrc`, it is also possible to achieve the same goal utilizing the 
`autocmd` event `VimEnter`. Because Event `VimEnter` is performed after all 
other startup stuff, commands called with this `autocmd` will take place after 
the loading of all plugins. The procedure is as following:

First create a function including all the plugin specific scripts in it. As 
an example, we initialise plugin `tabular` and `dragvisuals` here.

>
    function! g:LoadPluginScript ()
        " Tabularize {{{
        if exists(":Tabularize")
            vnoremap <Leader>t& :Tabularize /&<CR>
            vnoremap <Leader>t| :Tabularize /|<CR>
            vnoremap <Leader>t, :Tabularize /,<CR>
        endif
        " }}}
        " dragvisuals {{{
        if exists("*DVB_Drag()")
            vmap <expr> <LEFT>  DVB_Drag('left')
            vmap <expr> <RIGHT> DVB_Drag('right')
            vmap <expr> <DOWN>  DVB_Drag('down')
            vmap <expr> <UP>    DVB_Drag('up')
            vmap <expr> D       DVB_Duplicate()    
        endif
        " }}}
    endfunction
<

After the definition of this function, call it somewhere later in the 
~/.vimrc file with an `autocmd`. And all plugin initialisations that require 
the plugin to be loaded in the first place will take place accordingly.

    augroup plugin_initialize
        autocmd!
        autocmd VimEnter * call LoadPluginScript()
        " foo bar

I've successfully used this approach to have SeeTab.vim 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=628] automatically load by 
putting in the line:

>
    execute "SeeTab"
<

in my `after\plugin\SeeTab.vim` file with the original `SeeTab.vim` file in 
`plugin\SeeTab.vim`.

This works ok while gvim is open, but I get an error message when exiting:

>
    "E254: Cannot allocate color ."
<

How can I make this error not show up?

If I don't auto-load using the execute line, but instead type in the "SeeTab" 
command after gvim starts, then the error does not appear when exiting.

I'm using gvim 6.3 on WinXP.I'm also using blockhl.vim 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=104] if that might be 
causing any conflicts.

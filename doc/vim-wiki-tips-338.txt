Tip 292 (see below) doesn't seem to be true, at least not anymore. I am using 
cscope 15.4 and Vim 6.1. With a few hacks, I was able to get cscope to work 
with Vim under cygwin for Windows 2000. I did not need to change the sprintf 
line. The hacks included

1. Copying if_cscope.? to the src directory and the if_cscope.pro to the 
src/proto directory. These files do not come standard with the Windows source 
distribution of Vim. (I think it should - anybody in charge of distribution 
listening?)

2. Edit if_cscope.c to make the following changes:

Add the following includes:

>
    #include <sys/unistd.h>
    #include <sys/signal.h>
<

3. Edit Make_cyg.makAdd if_cscope.o to OBJ variable.Add a rule for this at 
the end

>
    $(OUTDIR)/if_cscope.o: if_cscope.c $(INCL)
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) if_cscope.c -o $(OUTDIR)/if_cscope.o
<

Uncomment the lines following

>
    #>>>>> uncomment this block to build a GUI version
<

4. Edit feature.hForce cscope compilation:

>
    #define FEAT_CSCOPE
<

5. make -f Make_cyg.mak GUI=yes

6. Note that the env variable TMPDIR should be defined in Vim for cscope to 
work correctly.

That should do it. Somebody in charge of distribution please make this 
standard. It would save a lot of trouble.

Tip 292 was not imported from its original location 
[http://www.vim.org/tips/tip.php?tip_id=292] due to duplicate tip titles. The 
content (slightly fixed) of tip 292 was:

I've found that Vim + cscope + cygwin does not work. The problem seems to be 
that in

>
    sprintf(cmd, "exec %s -dl -f %s", prog, csinfo[i].fname);
<

Vim execs cscope with the "-dl" options, causing it to fail. It is probably a 
cscope bug, but a simple workaround is to build Vim without that "d":

>
    sprintf(cmd, "exec %s -l -f %s", prog, csinfo[i].fname);
<

seems to work for me.

==============================================================================

Another alternative is to install the XFree86 packages that are part of the 
Cygwin distribution (http://xfree86.cygwin.com/ [http://xfree86.cygwin.com/]). 
I installed that along with the WindowMaker window manager. I then downloaded 
the Vim Unix source and edited the src/Makefile. I uncommented:

>
    CONF_OPT_CSCOPE = --enable-cscope
<

and

>
    CONF_OPT_GUI = --enable-gui=motif
<

I rebuilt Vim and installed it to /usr/bin/vim. I can now use cscope on 
Windows by running gvim (vim -g) in WindowMaker session.

There's a windows version of cscope here:

==============================================================================

Brian's note is quite clear. It's the best. Just one needs to install the 
Xfree86 packages by using the Cygwin's generic setup.exe. Once done just start 
the window maker command by using startx and proceed further.

==============================================================================

I just followed Brian's way by uncommenting CONF_OPT_CSCOPE = 
--enable-cscope. Cscope does work with Vim under cygwin, but it take almost 
half a minute to start up Vim

==============================================================================

I just downloaded the tarball from http://cscope.sourceforge.net 
[http://cscope.sourceforge.net] and didn't have to do anything special to get 
cscope + vim + cygwin working. Also cygwin now comes with mlcscope as a 
package.

==============================================================================

Here is how you can change the shape of your mouseptr in gvim.

>
    :set mouseshape=n:pencil
<

This will change the shape of the mouseptr to pencil in normal mode. You can 
choose different shapes for different modes. See :help 'mouseshape'.

Want more shapes?

Then look for the file cursorfont.h in your X11/ directory. This file 
contains lots of cursor shape #define definitions, like

>
    .
    #define XC_heart 62
    .
<

Now `:set mouseshape=n:62` will set the shape of the mouseptr to heart in 
normal mode.

Searching for a word across the project wastes most of the developres time, 
which can be avoided by the use of GNU Id_utils with VIM.

The procedure needs to be followed is as follows:

download GNU idutils 3.2d (mkid,lid,fid,fnid,xtokid) from 
http://www.mossbayeng.com/~ron/vim/builds.html 
[http://www.mossbayeng.com/~ron/vim/builds.html]

uncompress and store these files in the directory from where Vim is running.

goto the top level directory of the project, and run mkid, it will create ID 
file in that directory (As it is time consuming process, so be patient). copy 
this file ID to the directory from where Vim is running.

USAGE:

Put these lines in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    map _u :call ID_search()<Bar>execute "/\\<" . g:word . "\\>"<CR>
    map _n :n<Bar>execute "/\\<" . g:word . "\\>"<CR>
    function ID_search()
     let g:word = expand("<cword>")
     let x = system("lid --key=none ". g:word)
     let x = substitute(x, "\n", " ", "g")
     execute "next " . x
    endfun
<

To use it, place the cursor on a word, type "_u" and Vim will load the file 
that contains the word. Search for the next occurrence of the word in the same 
file with "n". Go to the next file with "_n".

The mapping of "_u" and "_n" can be done to some other key as per your 
preference but I use ^K and ^L for this purpose.

I haven't been able to get this to work. I downloaded and compiled the 
program (from here now: http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/ 
[http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/]) and it made the ID file. But I got the 
following error when I'd search:

E79: Cannot expand wildcards

I'm not really certain what problem this tip tries to solve, but here are 
some potential alternatives:
    - The Project plugin [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69] includes a "search in project" feature
    - You can Find in files within Vim [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Find_in_files_within_Vim] with a builtin command
    - :help  |tags-and-searches| tells you about Vim's built-in interface for jumping around in your code based on a premade data file.

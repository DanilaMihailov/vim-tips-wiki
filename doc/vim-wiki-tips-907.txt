==============================================================================

I keep some of my passwords in a Vim encrypted file (see :help |:X|). The 
encryption is not strong, but it may be sufficient for your requirements.

I can open the file in front of other people because the file has a modeline 
that enables folding so the passwords are hidden. For example, opening the 
file may show:

>
    my pc1
    +-- 3 lines mylogin1
    
    my pc2
    +-- 3 lines mylogin2
<

The file is organized in blocks separated by blank lines. In each block, all 
but the first line are indented, for example:

>
    my pc1
     mylogin1
     mypasswd1
    
    my pc2
     mylogin2
     mypasswd2
<

The first line of the file contains the following modeline:

>
    vi: noswapfile bufhidden=wipe tw=0 fdm=expr foldexpr=getline(v\:lnum)=~'^\\s\\|^$'
<

Explanation:
    - `noswapfile` keeps others from sniffing in the swapfile. 
    - `bufhidden=wipe` erases all session information when the file is left. 
    - The fold commands fold as described above.

Home-grown password management systems can easily give you a false sense of 
security. You might be better off with dedicated software, for example 
Password Safe [http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/].

==============================================================================

You could use `foldmethod=indent` instead.

==============================================================================

Some other settings may help for privacy:

>
    set nobackup
    set nowritebackup
    set viminfo=
<

==============================================================================

Consider using `foldclose=all` so that an open fold will automatically close 
after you leave it.

==============================================================================

For ~/.fetchmailrc I have done this to hide the passwords when editing in 
Vim.

>
    # vim: autoindent nobackup nowritebackup noswapfile bufhidden=wipe foldmethod=indent fdo=insert fcl=all fdl=1
    poll xxxxxx.xxxxx.xxx
     proto pop3
     auth password
     user "xxxxxxxxx"
     password "xxxxxxxx"
     is xxxxxx@xxxxxxxx.xxx
     nofetchall nokeep norewrite fetchlimit 100
<

`fdo=insert` will make it harder to accidentally open the fold with anything 
other than zo or i.

`fdl=1` will fold only the auth, user and password lines.

`fcl=all` will autoclose the folds on and deeper than the fdl parameter when 
leaving them.

The user and password lines will be folded once extra and seperating the user 
and password lines on two lines will make the fold not display the password 
line in "preview".

==============================================================================

Keeping modelines in an encrypted file gives a cracker a known plaintext 
string to look for when trying to brute force the encryption.

But, you can put something like this in your vimrc to avoid the modelines 
(assuming 'head' is available on your system):

>
    autocmd BufReadPre * if system("head -c 9 " . expand("<afile>")) == "VimCrypt~" | call SetupEncryption() | endif
    function SetupEncryption()
      " disable the swap file
      setlocal noswapfile
      " disable viminfo (global)
      set viminfo=
      " enable folding
      call SetupFolding()
      " auto-close folds
      set foldlevel=0
      set foldclose=all
      " make it harder to open folds by accident
      set foldopen=""
      " move cursor over word and press 'e' to obfuscate/unobfuscate it
      noremap e g?iw
    endfunction
<

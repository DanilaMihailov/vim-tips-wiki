==============================================================================

The ex command `g` is very useful for acting on lines that match a pattern. 
You can use it with the `d` command, to delete all lines that contain a 
particular pattern, or all lines that do not contain a pattern.

For example, to delete all lines containing "profile" (remove the `/d` to 
show the lines that the command will delete):

>
    :g/profile/d
<

More complex patterns can be used, such as deleting all lines that are empty 
or that contain only whitespace:

>
    :g/^\s*$/d
<

To delete all lines that do not contain a pattern, use `g!`, like this 
command to delete all lines that are not comment lines in a Vim script:

>
    :g!/^\s*"/d
<

Note that `g!` is equivalent to `v`, so you could also do the above with:

>
    :v/^\s*"/d
<

The next example shows use of `\|` ("or") to delete all lines except those 
that contain "`error`" or "`warn`" or "`fail`" (:help |pattern|):

>
    :v/error\|warn\|fail/d
<

Can we delete/not delete the line that precedes the search string?

like, in the below example i want the command to search for "keyword" and 
then ratain that and the line before that and deletes the test? Thank you!

<< file starts>>

this is the line that preceeds the search string

keyword

asdfgf asdfgf

lkjhj lkjhj

<< file ends>>

Easy, supply a Range to the d command: :g/keyword/-1d. --Fritzophrenic (talk) 22:09, May 20, 2015 (UTC)

==============================================================================

Can we remove all even numbered lines in a file using this feature. can we do 
some kind of math in the pattern. (ex: \=line(".") % 2)

Not really, but you can do that in two steps:

>
    :g/.*/if line('.')%2|call setline(line('.'), '===delete===')|endif
    :g/^==delete==$/d
<

If you simply put delete inside the if statement all the lines will be 
deleted. Much faster solution is to record a macro "ddj" and play it over the 
file.You could delete lines from several different ranges:

>
    :let range = range(10,15)+range(20,25)+range(30,35)
    :g/.*/if index(range, line('.')) != -1|call setline(line('.'), '===delete===')|endif
    :g/^===delete===$/d
<

But again I think the faster way to do that is to use :[range]d several 
times.

How would you instead of deleting, replace matched lines with a single 
newline between remaining lines?

Use s/// instead. Make sure your pattern matches the whole line (by using 
wildcards and/or anchors), and replace it with nothing:

>
    :s/.*pattern.*//
<

==============================================================================

When trying to reconcile differences between files, and using the new 'diff' 
functionality in Vim 6.0 you may want to automatically update the differences 
as you are working along. A convienent time is when you write out either of 
the files you are diff'ing. This autocmd will take care of doing that for you.

A more aggressive auto-diffupdate

is discussed on vim_use and should probably be merged into this tip.

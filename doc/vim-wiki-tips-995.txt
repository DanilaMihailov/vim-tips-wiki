==============================================================================

When using

>
    :set number
<

to show line numbers, your column alignment can be broken. However when 
you're in a window that supports it, the width of the window can be changed 
and as long as you've got enough screen real-estate to accommodate the extra 
columns your column alignment can be retained.

Add this to your vimrc file:

>
    function! Toggle_num()
      if !exists("g:grow")
        let g:grow = 8
      endif
      set number!
      if &number
        exec "set columns+=" . g:grow
      else
        exec "set columns-=" . g:grow
      endif
    endfunction
    map <M-n> :call Toggle_num()<CR>
<

So each time you use META-n, line numbers will be toggled and the appropriate 
number of columns will be added or removed from your vim window.

COMMENTS  *vwt-995-comments*

As of Vim 7.0, it's possible to change the line number column width using the 
numberwidth option. Of course, it doesn't really make sense now to always 
grow/shrink by 8 if numberwidth is set to, say, 4. So, an easy fix would be to 
change the line:

>
    let g:grow = 8
<

into:

>
    let g:grow = &numberwidth
<

==============================================================================

Could not execute shell commands ending with ampersand (&) in gvim running 
under FreeBSD. Commands like:

>
    :!xdvi &
    :!xterm &
<

did not work. This meant that I couldn't use vim-latex to view documents dvi 
since by default vim-latex sends a command ending with &. The problem does not 
occur in vim.

Hint: Check the parameters gvim is started with! In the KDE menu gvim is 
started with -f option which can cause this problem.

+The problem is solved if the shell is changed to ksh from the default sh or 
bash.

Install pdksh:

>
    $ su (su to root)
    # cd /usr/ports/shells/pdksh/
    #make install cleanset
<

Change the shell to ksh in .vimrc. Add:

>
    set sh=ksh
<

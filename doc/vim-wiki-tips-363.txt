==============================================================================

When you telnet to a remote machine and fire Vim on that machine, sometimes 
it takes a lot of time for Vim to start. instead if you use

>
    vim -X
<

it will start vim almost instantaneously. This is because "-X" options tells 
vim not to connect to the local X server, which can save a lot of startup 
time.

Also

>
    vim -X --noplugin
<

will not load any plugins in $VIMRUNTIME/plugin directory, this will again 
speed up the starting and is very useful especially when running vim from a 
Disk mounted over NFS.

COMMENTS  *vwt-363-comments*

This is great! I alway use vim via telnet on remote machines but it always 
tried to connect to my XServer. Up to now, I always made something like 'unset 
DISPLAY; vim ...'.

I think it's a bug in the manual pages since the option -X is not mentioned 
there (same applies for -O).

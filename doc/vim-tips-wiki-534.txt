==============================================================================

For all verilog users dealing with netlists, this an easier way to find out 
in which module you are really working in.add this map to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]. Press ``` to find out which module you 
are actually residing in.

>
    map ` ma?module<CR>Wyiw'a:echo "module -->" @0<CR>
<

This map works only when you are within the module. Placing it on 
module/endmodule does not make any sense.

An improved version of this if you are using a searching for a particular 
net/wire and then u want to know in which module you are really in. Add this 
to your vimrc

>
    map ` ma?module<CR>Wyiw'a/<Up><Up><CR>:echo "module -->" @0<CR>
<

If you are not searching for any particular net the above map will do.

==============================================================================

It's not working for me. Vim seems to be kind of hanging then i press C-C to 
break it.BTW but if some signals are having <module> in the signal names? 
Won't work i think!

==============================================================================

This will not work if you have module with names line module_AND...

==============================================================================

Also wont work if module is in commnets or something,I guess better solution 
would be to exclusively search for moduleI think the following will avoid both 
of the problems.

>
    :map <F6> ma?^\s*\<module\><CR>Wyiw'a:echo "module -->" @0<CR>
<

==============================================================================

Here's a version which doesn't pollute your search history:

>
    map ` :let old = @/<CR>ma?module<CR>Wyiw'a:call histdel('search',-1)<CR>:let @/ = old<CR>:echo "module -->" @0<CR>
<

==============================================================================I added a space after module to help when module is part of a name. Now I'd like to expand it or add another mapping to traverse up hierarchy.

warning: i couldn't get this to work except by entering the commands, maybe 
there is a way to get the let statement to work but for me it has problems 
with the quotes. I couldn't figure out a way to properly escape them.

have you ever had a function in C: doSomething(a, b, c); and you want to see 
what it's printing out? this wraps that function so the output looks like 
this:

>
    doSomething(a,b,c): 37
<

c for it looks like `printf("doSomething(a,b,c): \"%s\"\n", 
doSomething(a,b,c));`

kind of a pain to type often. i also try to make it so the cursor ends up 
over the s so that you can replace it with d, etc for printing things other 
than strings. again, this works if you type in the commands as they are 
depicted, but not with the let statement. if you want to do it by hand, do 
something like qt (to assign it to "t"). then type what's in between the 
quotes, starting with 0.

    :let @a = "0f(byt;iprintf("^[pa: "~@kb\"%s\"\n", ^[$i)^[?%^Ml^]"

You should use a debugger for this sort of operation.

==============================================================================

In fact, you can define

>
    #define hcffl printf("\n= [ %s : %s : %d ] =", \
     __FILE__,__FUNCTION__,__LINE__ \
     ); fflush(stdout);
<

then, add

>
    hcffl;
<

every where you need, and

>
    #define hcffl ;
<

to remove all these printf when make release version.

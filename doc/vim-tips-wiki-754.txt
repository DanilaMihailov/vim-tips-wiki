I was getting far too many errors creating ruby cgi-scripts due to misplaced 
curly braces, so here's my solution.

The following ruby script generates a pattern (see below) used for 
highlighting a codesection from the curly brace under the cursor to the 
matching brace. It currently finds 12 recursions, you can generate larger 
patterns reaching deeper by changing the parameter (n=12) in method 
"generate".



>
    # ruby script
    def next_iteration(text)
     text.gsub( /#{Regexp.quote("a%(x)*b")}/, "a%(%(a%(x)*b)|%(x))*b" )
    end
     
    def generate( text, n )
     1.upto(n){ |i| text = next_iteration( text ) }
     text
    end
     
    def to_pattern(text)
     text.gsub(/x/,"\\n|[^ab]").gsub(/a/,"\\{").gsub(/b/,"\\}")
    end
     
    ax = generate("a%(x)*b", 12).sub(/b$/,"")
    # a = starting brace, b = ending brace, x = characters in between
    puts to_pattern( "/\\v%(%##{ax}b)|%(#{ax}%#b)/" )
<

"a" and "b" are synonyms for the starting/ending brace, "x" holds the 
characters in between, if any. Using recursion, the original pattern "a(x)*b" 
is expanded to the monstrous pattern seen below.

Note: Use %() for grouping in the pattern, as the normal (captivating) 
variant cannot be used that often in one pattern.

Append the following to your vimrc:

>
    highlight ShowMatches guibg=darkgrey guifg=white
    au! Cursorhold * exe 'match ShowMatches /\v%(%#\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(\n|[^\{\}])*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(%(\{%(\n|[^\{\}])*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*\})|%(\n|[^\{\}]))*%#\})/'
    set ut=30
<

Up to now, creating a pattern for mixing curly braces and brackets hasn't 
been very successful. The resulting patterns grow far too fast.

TO DO Is the above useful for Vim 7?

It is not the same thing as matchparen

Need to clarify what the tip actually does (a reader shouldn't have to decode 
stuff to work this out). What's that ruby script for, and why does it start 
the tip? Is this tip superseded by rainbow_parenthesis?

Is rainbow_parenthesis just script#1561 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561]? The text on that page 
doesn't give much of a description. Someone needs to install it and tell 
readers what it does. Or, maybe we should delete this tip if no one wants to 
fix it by, say, July 2008. --JohnBeckett

I tried this and in certain C files I am getting ERRORE363: pattern caused 
out-of-stack error

It crashes Vim 6.3

To enhance Calendar script#52 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=52] with display of special 
dates:

Step 1. Create a file called "holidays" in the directory assigned to 
g:calendar_diary (default value for g:calendar_diary is ~/diary).

This file will contain the special dates. Essence of contents of the holidays 
file is the special dates encoded as (10000+(month*100)+day).

Example contents of file g:calendar_diary/holidays

>
    List of holidays: ^(10000 + ((month * 100)+day))
    
    Encoded   Sign   Color   Description
    Date
    
    10101     n      blue    Jan 01   (Wed)      - New Year's Day
    10217     p      blue    Feb 17   (Mon)      - President's Day
    10214     v      red     Feb 14   (Fri)      - Valentine's Day
    10414     s      green   Apr 14   (Mon)      - Spring Break
    10526     m      blue    May 26   (Mon)      - Memorial Day
    10703     i      gold
    10704     i      gold    Jul 3&4  (Thu & Fri)- Independence Day + 1 day
    10901     l      blue    Sep 01   (Mon)      - Labor Day
    11127     t      blue    Nov 27&28(Thu & Fri)- Thanksgiving Day + 1 day
    11128     t      blue
    11225     c      silver  Dec 25&26(Thu & Fri)- Christmas Day + 1 day
    11226     c      silver  Dec 25&26(Thu & Fri)- Christmas Day + 1 day
<

Step 2. Add the following to your vimrc file:

>
    let calendar_sign = 'MyGetSpecialDay'
    function! MyGetSpecialDay(day, month, year)
      let l:m100d = 10000 + (a:month * 100 ) + a:day
      let l:holidays = expand(g:calendar_diary) . "/holidays"
      exe "split " . l:holidays
      let l:found = search(l:m100d)
      if l:found
        let l:found = 'h'
      endif
      quit
      return l:found
    endfunction
<

Note: The preceding constitutes basic support for display of special dates. 
With this basic support, all special dates are shown with the same sign (viz. 
+) and the same highlight color. An enhancement would be to pick up the sign 
and the highlight color from the holidays file. (Also, I suspect management of 
buffer for the holidays file can be speeded up, perhaps by opening it only 
once, keeping it in the background and searching with warp-around flag ('w').)

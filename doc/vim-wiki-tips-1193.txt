==============================================================================

Just use the "htmlm4.vim" syntax script. (I got this from VimTip1041 
|vwt-1041|, but it was non-obvious to somebody looking for a quick answer.)

Put simply, while in normal mode, type the following:

>
    :set filetype=htmlm4
<

You can automatically load this syntax for all html files by adding the 
following line to your vimrc:

>
    au BufRead *.html set filetype=htmlm4
<

This tip is FALSE. htmlm4 is a filetype for documents which contain both HTML 
and M4 parts and syntax/htmlm4.vim just combine syntax/html.vim and 
syntax/m4.vim, so that there is no special treatment on embedded 
CSS/javascript in syntax/htmlm4.vim. Such treatment is a part of 
syntax/html.vim. So that this tip is false. You don't have to do the above 
configuration.

Thanks, but please spell out what you think we on the wiki should do (assuming I don't want to take the time to figure it all out). Are you saying:
The title of the tip is "Syntax highlighting for HTML with embedded Javascript".
You automatically get that functionality (assuming say Vim 7) if filetype is html.
So there is nothing in this tip that is worth keeping.
We should delete this tip.

Try it for your self, at least in my w3 compliant html file with embed js, 
syntax/html doesn't give the correct highlighting but syntax/htmlm4 does. For 
that reason alone I think this page should stay. A counter intuative and 
suprising work around, but if it works, it works.



After setting filetype=html4 on my file with a bunch of HTML and a bunch of Javascript that was getting highlighted poorly, I tried 'set filetype=html' which worked well. I don't really know the details on what happened, but its worth a try. YMMV.

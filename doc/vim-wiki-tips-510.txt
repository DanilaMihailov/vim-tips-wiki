In general, $VIMRUNTIME cannot be set within vimrc.

This tip is for those who want to avoid setting $VIMRUNTIME as an 
enviromental variable (either rc file on Unix or enviroment on Windows).

I found the following steps worked on my PC and Unix:
    - Find out your $VIM (on Windows, it is the directory where gvim.exe lives).
    - Create a directory called doc under $VIM (now, we have $VIM/doc).
    - Copy help.txt from official $VIMRUNTIME/doc (now, we have $VIM/doc/help.txt).


Now, we can set $VIMRUNTIME within vimrc, for example

>
    let $VIMRUNTIME='C:/usr/share/vim/vim63'
<

I find it is useful on PC especially when I have cygwin installed, thus a 
single copy of VIMRUNTIME can be shared for both vi (cygwin version) and 
gvim.exe (win32 version).

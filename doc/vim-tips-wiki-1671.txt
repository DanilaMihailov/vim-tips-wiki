==============================================================================

In normal mode, typing `gm` moves the cursor to the middle of the current 
screen line. With 'wrap' on, a long line may be wrapped so it appears on 
several screen lines. Typing `gm` moves the cursor to the middle of the 
current line on the screen (or to the end of the line, if it ends before the 
middle of the screen).

This tips remaps `gm` so the cursor is moved to the middle of the current 
physical line. Any leading or trailing whitespace is ignored: the cursor moves 
to the middle of the text between the first and last non-whitespace 
characters.

I have removed the following from the tip because I can't make it do anything 
useful. If an explanation or fix is available, please restore it.

onoremap makes sense, xmap doesn't work, because visual mode is exited. One could possibly get around it by using an <expr> mapping.Chrisbra (talk) 09:53, July 1, 2013 (UTC)
Thanks, but I think I meant that we should give an example of where the onoremap does something useful. For example, I just tried it again with a long line that was wrapped over several screen lines. Typing gm went to the middle of the physical line, but going back to the same starting position and typing vgm does not select the text that the first command moved over. Instead, the gm goes to the middle of the screen line. JohnBeckett (talk) 11:09, July 2, 2013 (UTC)

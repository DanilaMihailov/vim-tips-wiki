==============================================================================

In program development, it is common to use the name of the current file as a 
classname, after omitting the path and extension of the file. One way to do 
this quickly is to use an insert-mode abbreviation. In the following example 
,f is mapped as an abbreviation for the filename without the path and 
extension. Add the following lines to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] file to define the abbreviation:

>
    " Insert classname (filename minus path and extension).
    iab <buffer> <unique> ,f <C-r>=expand('%:t:r')<CR>
<

In insert mode, typing <C-r>= (Ctrl-R then =) inserts the value of the 
following expression. The expression is expand('%:t:r') (terminated by <CR> 
which represents Enter).

The expand() function expands '%' (representing the name of the current 
file), while modifying that name according to the given codes: :t is the tail 
of the full path name (file name and extension, after omitting any path), and 
:r is the root part of the name after omitting any extension.

To use this, while in insert mode, type ,f followed by a space or the escape 
key to insert the name of the current file.

Rather than vimrc, the mapping should be in a file in a filetype plugin 
directory. Then, using <buffer> would be useful (the abbreviation would only 
apply for files of that type). The tip needs some rewording for that.

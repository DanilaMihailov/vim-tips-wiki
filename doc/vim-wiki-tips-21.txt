==============================================================================

In Vim, the unnamed register is the " register, and the WindowsClipboard is 
the * register.

This means that if you yank something, you have to yank it to the * register 
if you want to paste it into a Windows app. If this is too much trouble, set 
the 'clipboard' option to 'unnamed'. Then you always yank to *.

So pasting to windows apps doesn't require prefixing "* :

>
    set clipboard=unnamed
<

COMMENTS                                                     *vwt-21-comments*

You can also have the Visual selection automatically copied to the clipboard. 
If you

>
    :set go+=a
<

and then make a Visual selection, you can switch to another application (such 
as your mail reader) and paste.
    - :help 'guioptions' 
    - :help |quotestar| 


==============================================================================

Since the * buffer won't allow (as far as I know anyway) appending to it, you 
can also do something like:

>
    "aY
<

to grab a line then move somewhere else

>
    "AY
<

to append another line to the a buffer. Then:

>
    :let @*=@a
<

This puts both lines into the * buffer for pasting.

==============================================================================

This tip, `set clipboard=unnamed`, also works under the X windowing system.

Well, if you still have a good ol' 3-button mice and paste by middle-clicking, yeah it works. But keyboard shortcuts for clipboard operations in modern GUI apps (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, etc) - they don't play along with clipboard=unnamed. -- 213.85.69.114 21:30, January 17, 2011 (UTC)

On Windows, the clipboard is both "* and "+. On X11 they are different, but 
the one used for Edit=>Cut, Edit=>Copy and Edit=>Paste (both in gvim and in 
non-Vim applications) is actually the + register. — Tonymec

True, under X11, + is the clipboard register, while * is selection register. Newer vim versions (7.3.74 and higher) finally have a variation of clipboard=unnamed option which allows you to alias unnamed register to the + register: set clipboard=unnamedplus. Enjoy! -- 213.85.69.114 21:23, January 17, 2011 (UTC)

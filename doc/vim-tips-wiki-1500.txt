==============================================================================

This tip shows you how to open files from the command line in the same window 
(Vim instance), using applescript. The applescript is specific to Vim.app.

Create a file called gvim.scpt (for example) with the following applescript 
code:

>
    on run argv
       tell application "Vim"
          repeat with n from 1 to (count of argv)
             set theUnixPath to item n of argv
             set theMacPath to (POSIX file theUnixPath) as string
             open file theMacPath
          end repeat
          activate
       end tell
    end run
<

This applescript tells a running Vim.app to open each argument in a new 
buffer. The script can be invoked with the 'osascript' command ('man 
osascript' for details): a good way to do this is to create a shell script 
somewhere in your path:

>
    #!/bin/sh
    osascript /path/to/gvim.scpt $*
<

What this doesn't do yet: Create the files automatically if they do not 
exist. In fact the script will fail and complain if you pass the name of a 
file that doesn't exist, and any following files also won't be opened.

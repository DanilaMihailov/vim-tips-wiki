==============================================================================

I wanted to start using folding without having to get used to seeing the 
(default) markers, aka {{{ and }}}. So, here are two autocmds that will make 
them fade to black (bg=black, fg=black). Alternatively, you could use the 
Ignore highlighting group.

Method 1:

>
    au BufRead,BufNewfile * syn match fmrkr '"*{{{\|"*}}}' |
      \ syn cluster vimCommentGroup contains=fmrkr |
      \ hi fmrkr term=NONE guibg=black guifg=black
      \ ctermbg=black ctermfg=black
<

Method 2:

>
    au BufRead,BufNewfile * syn match fmrkr '"*{{{\|"*}}}'
      \ containedin=vimLineComment contained |
      \ hi fmrkr term=NONE guibg=black guifg=black
      \ ctermbg=black ctermfg=black
<

Both methods accomplish the same thing, but in a different way. Simply pick 
one and see those annoying markers fade away.

I just tried it out with Vim files, but you can easily modify it for any 
other filetypes.

    - See VimTip99 |vwt-99| to determine what highlighting group the cursor is in. 


COMMENTS  *vwt-241-comments*

TO DO It might be better to:
    - Use add= instead of contains= for the syn cluster 
    - Use Syntax autocmd event instead of BufRead,BufNewfile for both methods 
    - With the above, make it trigger only for the correct language (e.g. autocmd 
      Syntax vim ...) 
    - Would also like to see that the color selected was the current background 
      color not just black (if I understand things)

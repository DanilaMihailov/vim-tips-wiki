This tip is for when you are working with a two-window vertical diff 
(comparing two files, side-by-side).

Use ]c and [c to go to a specific change. Then use M-, and M-. to patch using 
the version on the left or right respectively. The cursor is then positioned 
in the file that changed for ease of saving, etc.

I find this more intuitive than using diffput and diffget because I no longer 
need to remember which window the cursor is in.

The code:

>
    function! DiffTake(dir, oppdir)
      let l:old = winnr()
      exec "wincmd ".a:dir
      " Assumption: just 2 windows side by side.
      if (winnr() == l:old)
        diffput
        exec "wincmd ".a:oppdir
      else
        wincmd p
        diffget
      endif
    endfunction
    
    function! SetupDiffMappings()
      if &diff
        map <Esc>, :call DiffTake("h", "l")<CR>
        map <Esc>. :call DiffTake("l", "h")<CR>
      endif
    endfunction
    
    " vim -d
    call SetupDiffMappings()
    " Entering diff mode from within vim - diffsplit, etc.
    autocmd FilterWritePost * call SetupDiffMappings()

You might also like these settings (but it will require a little savy on 
keeping which side is which):

>
    " <F11> moves to "previous" change location,
    " <F12> moves to "next" change location,
    map <F11> [c
    map <F12> ]c
    
    " SHIFT<F12> does a "diff put" change location,
    map <S-F12> dp

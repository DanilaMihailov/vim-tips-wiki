==============================================================================

I keep forgetting to change the dates in my file headers. Even though it 
isn't extremely important before the release time, I found it helpful to 
automate the process. The following is tuned more for Rebol headers than 
anything else, but it works for most types of files. As a bonus, it increments 
the last part of a version field; that can be commented out if it isn't 
desired.

I should probably search for the end of headers marked by comment leaders 
(such as Vim scripts), but haven't gotten around to it. It also fails to find 
version numbers that don't terminate at the end of the line.

CREAM ADDON                                              *vwt-789-cream-addon*

Cream has an add-on that uses a dialog to do timestamps:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cream/cream/addons/cream-timestamp.vim?view=markup 
[http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cream/cream/addons/cream-timestamp.vim?view=markup]

It provides eight date format options, picks up the timezone and provides a 
global to change/provide it if your OS doesn't (Windows). The default button 
is set to the last used, and if you don't like the default stamp tag 
"Updated:", you can change the global to make it anything you want. Whitespace 
is also preserved after the tag.

Cream also has a sister add-on that does a similar thing with the filename:

==============================================================================

In Vim you can edit directories, but sometimes it is more convenient to have 
the names of all files in the complete subtree listed in one buffer. The netrw 
plugin which creates the directory listing can be tweaked to show a tree view, 
by using the g:netrw_liststyle variable in your .vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] or from the command-line before invoking 
the directory explorer:

>
    :let g:netrw_liststyle=3
<

Sometimes though, you may simply want to list out all the files in a 
directory tree in a buffer. The below function does just this. It globs the 
file names of the current directory and iterates through all the names, 
globbing it again if it is a directory. Note, it can be very slow for large 
directories.

The following mapping abbreviates the invocation to pressing \L':

>
    map <Leader>L :call ListTree('.')<CR>
    function! ListTree(dir)
      new
      set buftype=nofile
      set bufhidden=hide
      set noswapfile
      normal i.
      while 1
        let file = getline(".")
        if (file == '')
          normal dd
        elseif (isdirectory(file))
          normal dd
          let @" = glob(file . "/*")
          normal O
          normal P
          let @" = glob(file . "/.[^.]*")
          if (@" != '')
            normal O
            normal P
          endif
        else
          if (line('.') == line('$'))
            return
          else
            normal j
          endif
        endif
      endwhile
    endfunction

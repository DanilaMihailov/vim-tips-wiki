==============================================================================

It can be convenient to scroll down or up by one line, while not changing the 
cursor screen line.

You can scroll down in this way by typing <C-e>j (Ctrl-e to scroll down to 
see more text at the bottom, and `j` to move the cursor down so its screen 
line hasn't changed). An alternative is 1<C-d> (Ctrl-d to scroll down, with a 
count of `1` which sets the 'scroll' option to 1 so one line is scrolled).

A superior solution is to place the following in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]. This script behaves better at the top and 
bottom of the buffer, and does not change the 'scroll' option. Press Ctrl-J to 
scroll down or Ctrl-K to scroll up, in normal and visual modes.

For PageDown and PageUp, see the comments in Page up/down and keep cursor 
position |vtw-320|.

==============================================================================

If you want to keep the cursor centered vertically, you can also set 
scrolloff to a large value (such as 50). This won't work if you want the 
cursor closer to the edge, but it has the benefit that it works with all 
movement commands.

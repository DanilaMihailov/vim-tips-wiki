==============================================================================

You can use Vim as a refactoring tool. The advantages are:

You can expect much from a refactoring tool but if you have a look at the 
commercial refactoring tools there is much (not all!) Vim can do too.

I give you three examples, all in C#.

EXAMPLE 1: THE EXTRACT METHOD REFACTORING *vwt-589-example-1:-the-extract-method-refactoring*

Sphagetti code example:

>
    public string CreateMenu(string startMenu,string file)
    {
         string strOutput = "";
         int i = 0;
         ArrayList startArray = new ArrayList();
         string strVariable = "";
         string strTemp = "";
         XmlDocument XMLDoc = new XmlDocument();
         try {
             XMLDoc.Load(file);
         }
         catch (Exception e) {
         strOutput = e.GetBaseException().ToString();
         return strOutput;
         }
         XmlNodeList nodeList = XMLDoc.DocumentElement.ChildNodes;
         ...
<

Imagine 50 lines of code here.

Use the extract method refactoring to make a composed method.

I use a Vim function (see below) to build the extracted method.

I highlight the code part I want to extract and press `\em` (for extract 
method).

A dialog appears and asks me how to name the new method.

I type in "GetXmlDocumentFrom" and do get this:

>
    // = GetXmlDocumentFrom();
    private GetXmlDocumentFrom()
    {
        XmlDocument XMLDoc = new XmlDocument();
        try {
            XMLDoc.Load(file);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            strOutput = e.GetBaseException().ToString();
            return strOutput;
        }
        // return ;
    }
<

Now I have time to think what parameters the method needs and what to return.

I end up with the following function and remove it from the original 
function:

>
    private XmlDocument GetXmlDocumentFrom(string XmlFile)
    {
        XmlDocument XMLDoc = new XmlDocument();
        string strOutput = "";
        try
        {
            XMLDoc.Load(XmlFile);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            strOutput = e.GetBaseException().ToString();
            ErrorMessage(strOutput);
        }
        return XMLDoc;
    }
<

In the original code I put two lines.

>
    XmlDocument XMLDoc = new XmlDocument();
    XMLDoc = GetXmlDocumentFrom(XmlFile);
<

So I reduced the original code for 8 lines and made it clearer what the code 
does.

I do this with the rest of the code again and again.

Since the class gets bloated because of the many new methods I later will use 
the Extract Class refactoring to put this method in an own XmlDocument-class.

This has the advantage that our new function is also available for other 
similar purposes.

I will create the new class also with the help of Vim, the actual extracting 
of the method into the new class is just a matter of copy & paste.

Here is the Vim code:

>
    vmap \em :call ExtractMethod()<CR>
    function! ExtractMethod() range
      let name = inputdialog("Name of new method:")
      '<
      exe "normal! O\<BS>private " . name ."()\<CR>{\<Esc>"
      '>
      exe "normal! oreturn ;\<CR>}\<Esc>k"
      s/return/\/\/ return/ge
      normal! j%
      normal! kf(
      exe "normal! yyPi// = \<Esc>wdwA;\<Esc>"
      normal! ==
      normal! j0w
    endfunction
<

EXAMPLE 2: THE SELF ENCAPSULATE FIELD REFACTORING *vwt-589-example-2:-the-self-encapsulate-field-refactoring*

I have heard a programmer who just uses Visual Studio (nothing against Visual 
Studio, it's a great tool!) say: "I do not use properties. It's too much 
work." He just uses fields instead.

With Vim it is no problem to write a property, that is, to use the Self 
Encapsulate Field refactoring.

I write a name e.g. `Name` press `CTRL-C CTRL-P CTRL-S` (create property with 
string). Voila, the new property appears in just a second:

>
    private string m_Name;
    public string Name
    {
        get
        {
            return m_Name;
        }
        set
        {
            m_Name = value;
        }
    }
<

Here are the Vim mappings and the underlying function:

>
    "Create property
    imap <C-c><C-p><C-s> <Esc>:call CreateProperty("string")<CR>a
    imap <C-c><C-p><C-i> <Esc>:call CreateProperty("int")<CR>a
    function! CreateProperty(type)
      exe "normal bim_\<Esc>b\"yywiprivate ".a:type." \<Esc>A;\<CR>public ".a:type.
            \ " \<Esc>\"ypb2xea\<CR>{\<Esc>oget\<CR>{\<CR>return " .
            \ "\<Esc>\"ypa;\<CR>}\<CR>set\<CR>{\<CR>\<Tab>\<Esc>\"yPa = value;\<CR>}\<CR>}\<CR>\<Esc>"
      normal! 12k2wi
    endfunction
<

You can combine Visual Studio and Vim. You can work in Visual Studio and load 
the file in Vim for refactoring. I have made a menu entry in Visual Studio 
that loads the actual file I am writing in Vim (cf. Vim as an External Tool 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Integrate_gvim_with_Visual_Studio#Vim_as_an_External_Tool]).

EXAMPLE 3: THE REPLACE CONDITIONAL WITH POLYMORPHISM REFACTORING *vwt-589-example-3:-the-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism-refactoring*

Imagine a switch and you want to replace it with an abstract class and some 
concrete classes which inherit from this parent class.

You may think "Why should I replace this switch? It's too much work. Writing 
all these classes ..."

With Vim it's just a question of a few seconds.

To build the abstract class I type, say `Fruit`.

Then I press `CTRL-C CTRL-A CTRL-C` (create abstract class) and get

>
    public abstract class Fruit
    {
        public abstract void |();
    }
                             | is the cursor position
<

Now I fill in the methods.

>
    public abstract class Fruit
    {
        public abstract void Taste();
        public abstract void Color();
        public abstract string GetSize();
    }
<

Now I go on the first letter of `Fruit` and type `CTRL-C CTRL-C CTRL-C` 
(create concrete class).

A dialog appears and asks me for the new name of the concrete class. I type 
in `Apple` and get

>
    public class Apple : Fruit
    {
        public override void Taste()
        {
        }
        public override void Color()
        {
        }
        public override string GetSize()
        {
        }
    }
<

I continue doing so with all the child classes of the abstract class.

In this way I get code templates that I can implement now.

Here are my mappings and the underlying funtion.

>
    "Create abstract class
    imap <C-c><C-a><C-c> <Esc>bipublic abstract class <Esc>A<CR>{<CR>public abstract void X();<CR>}<Esc>:?X<CR>0fXs
    "Create concrete class
    map <C-c><C-c><C-c> :silent! call ImplementAbstractClass()<CR>
    function! ImplementAbstractClass() range
      exe "normal \<Esc>\"yyw"
      /{
      normal "xy%
      normal %o
      exe "normal! \<Esc>o"
      let name = inputdialog("Name of new method:")
      exe "normal! ipublic class " .name." : \<Esc>\"yp\"xp"
      exe "normal! }O}\<Esc>=="
      normal %v%
      normal! gv
      '<,'>s/abstract/override/g
      normal! gv
      '<,'>s/;/\r{\r}\r/g
      normal! ==
      normal %kdd%k
    endfunction
<

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-589-comments*

These are amazing! I never thought of doing this, but I have to say your tips 
are quite amazing! I have begun to use hints 1 and 2 religiously, especially 
when I have to dig around through code that others have written! Thank you!!

==============================================================================

Here is a variation

>
    imap <C-c><C-p> <Esc>:call CreateProperty()<CR>a
    function! CreateProperty()
      exe "normal bim_\<Esc>b\"yyybiprivate \<Esc>A;\<CR>\<Esc>\"ypw\"xyw\<Esc>2xbipublic \<Esc>$a\<CR>{\<Esc>oget\<CR>{\<CR>return \<Esc>\"xpa;\<CR>}\<CR>set\<CR>{\<CR>\<Tab>\<Esc>\"xPa = value;\<CR>}\<CR>}\<CR>\<Esc>"
      normal 12k2wi
    endfunction
<

This will create a property from a <type> <Field Name>. This alleviates the 
need for multiple mappings for each data type in the vimrc file

So if you want to create a property from `Rectangle Box` just press 
<C-c><C-p> and you get

>
    private Rectangle m_Box;
    public Rectangle Box
    {
        get
        {
            return m_Box;
        }
        set
        {
            m_Box = value;
        }
    }
<

I am still trying to get rid of some extra spaces in property name but I hope 
this helps.

==============================================================================

One of Vim's most useful features is its ability to record what you type for 
later playback. :help |recording| This is most useful for repeated jobs which 
cannot easily be done with ".".

To start recording, press q in normal mode followed by a letter (a to z). 
That starts recording keystrokes to the specified register. Vim displays 
recording in the status line. Type any normal mode commands, or enter insert 
mode and type text. To stop recording, again press q while in normal mode.

To playback your keystrokes, press @ followed by the letter previously 
chosen. Typing @@ repeats the last playback.

To delete a recording just record nothing over it. For example, qxq erases 
whatever was recorded to register x.

or :call setreg('x', '')
or :let @x = ''

==============================================================================

Here is an example to replace string OldString with NewString contained in 
multiple *.cpp files:

>
    vim *.cpp
    qx            # start recording to register x
    :%s/OldString/NewString/g
    :wnext
    q             # stop recording
    @x            # playback to see if it works correctly
    999@x         # repeat 999 times to complete the job
<

==============================================================================

One way to edit a recording (for example, to register x) is to paste it into 
a new buffer, then edit the buffer, then copy the results back into the 
register. For example:

>
    :new      # new buffer
    "xp       # paste register x into the buffer
    [edit the keystrokes]
    <Esc>     # return to normal mode
    0"xy$     # go to beginning of line; into register x, yank to end of line
    :bd!      # delete the new buffer without saving
    @x        # execute modified recording
<

Alternatively, edit the contents of register x in the command line:

>
    :let @x="<Ctrl-R><Ctrl-R>x"
<

The name @x identifes register x. At the command line, Ctrl-R pastes the 
contents of the named register into the command line, thus making it available 
for editing.

be careful about newlines

==============================================================================

I got really bored of editing multiple vimrc files when I wanted to change 
mine. So, after installing cygwin under Windows I added an environment 
variable which set HOME to be c:\cygwin\home\username. Vim/GVim in Windows 
reads that variable if it is set and notes that the config file to read is the 
one I have in my cygwin directory. Also, because Vim/GVim under Windows 
understands that the config files could be called either .vimrc or _vimrc it 
doesn't require any other change. Now when either Vim in cygwin or Vim/GVim in 
Windows loads, they both use the same config files. This assumes that your 
config files can work under either environment as mine do.

Another option (if for some reason you don't want to change your Windows HOME 
var) is to create a vimrc file in your Windows home with the following lines:

>
    set runtimepath+=c:/cygwin/home/username/.vim
    source c:/cygwin/home/username/_vimrc
<

==============================================================================

I think if you have installed cygwin, you can use the following method:under 
cygwin:

>
    $ cd ~
    $ ln -s /path/to/windows/_vimrc .vimrc
<

and by this way, we can use the same vimrc. Don't forget we can use " if 
has('win32') ..." to write config for different environment.

==============================================================================

Be careful with setting $HOME to something else under Windows. A lot of apps 
rely on such variable as well. You may end up messing up another app`s 
settings.

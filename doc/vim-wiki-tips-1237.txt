==============================================================================

If you love regular expressions, you probably like to use them everywhere. 
Unfortunately it gets very confusing when you use Vim's regular expressions, 
Perl and POSIX compliant varieties in PHP, and then command-line grep as well, 
because they all seem to have different rules as to which characters have 
special meaning on their own and which do not. Quite often I need several 
attempts to write a search pattern because I can't remember which characters 
need to be preceded by a backslash.

Thankfully, any Vim search pattern can include the special sequence \v (very 
magic), and this will make every following character except a-zA-Z0-9 and '_' 
have special meaning. Using \V has the opposite effect: all characters have 
their literal meaning and must be preceded by \ to activate their special 
meaning. So if you have forgotten which characters have special meaning in 
Vim, start the pattern with \v or \V to switch them all on or off.

Vim's default 'magic' setting makes characters have the same meaning as in 
grep, and \v (very magic) makes them the same as the extended regular 
expressions used by egrep.

Regular expressions in scripts should always specify one of \v, \m, \M, or 
\V, to make them immune to the user's 'magic' setting.

The :substitute command has the :smagic and :snomagic alternate forms (the 
same as \m and \M), so you can search and replace 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace] with %sno/regex/new_text/g. 
Alternatively, you might find it helpful to refine your regular expression by 
searching with /\v first, then you can insert your regular expression by 
typing:

:s/<Ctrl-R>/

PERMANENT VERY MAGIC MODE  *vwt-1237-permanent-very-magic-mode*

Vim does not have an option to use "very magic" by default (whereas :set 
ignorecase will always ignore case 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Searching#Case_sensitivity] unless \C is used). 
The following mappings, however, effectively achieve the same purpose (from 
stackoverflow [http://stackoverflow.com/a/23021259/1858225]):

>
    nnoremap / /\v
    vnoremap / /\v
    cnoremap %s/ %smagic/
    cnoremap \>s/ \>smagic/
    nnoremap :g/ :g/\v
    nnoremap :g// :g//
<

This does not work with `:g` and interferes somewhat with Vim's 
search-history behavior (see the StackOverflow link). An alternative solution 
is to use this plugin: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4849

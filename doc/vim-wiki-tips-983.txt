==============================================================================

There are several tips surrounding numbering here in the collection. This is 
an effort to summarize and consolidate them.

One of vi's unique features is the ability to display line numbers alongside 
our text. :set number (or :set nu for short) enables this mode. Obviously this 
is most useful when dealing with code and when using ex ranges (:xxx,nnn ...). 
However, it does tend to push all of the text several columns to the right 
which can make for quite a bit of ugly line wrapping when dealing with text 
that was already wrapped close to the width of your text.

Switching the mode on or off can be tedious (8 or 10 keystrokes). The 
following pair of mappings reduces that to just two:

>
    :map gn :set nu<CR>
    :map gN :set nonu<CR>
<

Those are so simple they'll work in any version of vi (not just vim).

Alternatively we can just make one macro (vim specific) which toggles the 
number mode state:

>
    :map gn :set invnu<CR>
<

(The functions in VimTip 757 aren't necessary; if we've read VimTip 37 which 
covers using the inv prefix to boolean settings to "invert," or toggle, their 
current state).

To make a toggling macro like this in an older version of vi we could use a 
moderately ugly hack. In our .exrc file we'd set the initial macro/state:

>
    map gn :set nu<CR>:so ~/.exrc.nonu<CR>
    ... and then in our ~/.exrc.nonu file we toggle it:
    map gn :set nonu<CR>:so ~/.exrc.nu<CR>
<

In other words; we use the :source command to remap the macro each time it's 
called. (That trick can be used generically for toggles and for cycling among 
lists of states, if we're willing to clutter our home directory with all those 
little fiddly bits. Thankfully this is vim and we can dispense with all that.

Of course these examples are following the common convention of using "g" as 
a prefix for our custom mappings since the "g" key is unused in standard vi 
and the n and N bindings don't conflict with any vim defaults. We could bind 
them to "zn" and "zN" (since "z" is the other common vi mapping prefix). 
However we would be over-riding a couple of vim specific mappings (for 
foldenable related settings).

When vi students ask me about line numbering I have to clarify if they want 
the numbers displayed or if they want numbers inserted into selected sequences 
of their text. vi can handle either case with alacrity. The following macro 
will filter a sequence of lines from the "n" mark to the current one through 
the UNIX nl (number lines) filter.

>
    :map g# :'n,. !nl<CR>
<

So simple it's almost not worthy of a tip. Of course one could use 'cat -n' 
or any simple 'awk' or Perl script in lieu of the 'nl' utility and one could 
certainly customize this with custom arguments controlling the width and 
number formatting options, at least with the GNU version of 'nl.' (The Perl 
script in VimTip 569, "Insert line numbers or filter thru perl", would be 
equivalent to GNU: nl -w3 -s:)

Note I use the "n" marker for this to emphasize that I'm intent on NUMBERING 
a range of lines. That's handy because I usually use the "a" mark first for 
general purposes such as yanking or deleting. Using "n" here minimizes the 
risk that I'll inadvertantly number a large range of lines to one of my 
general purpose marks. (VimTip 28 offers a function using vim native built-ins 
for users on non-UNIX systems without the 'nl' utility. However my advice to 
them is: install Cygwin!).

(VimTip 65 offers an unecessarily complex suggestion for numbering all the 
lines of a file. One can simply use :%!nl[Enter] for that. Only six keystrokes 
for something which is not a common requirement. The g# macro above is useful 
for programmers and programming instructors or technical writers when 
including and discussing excerpts of code).

VimTip 124 provides a more elaborate function which can take arguments for 
starting indices, and offers other features. However, it's elaborate enough 
that I'd probably never remember to call it when I needed it.

In cases where I need to generate a sequence of similar lines which differ 
only in a few places by embeded numbers, I generally just write a simple shell 
command using a for loop, the GNU 'seq' utility (which, can be implemented in 
about 5 lines of shell if you're on a machine that lacks it) and echo 
statements). For example I sometimes find myself editing DNS zone and reverse 
zone files and using simple commands like:

>
    :r! for i in $(seq 5 200);do echo -e "dyn$i.my.org\t\tIN A 192.168.1.$i"; done
<

to generate most of my text.

VimTip 150 tells us how to generate a column of increasing numbers using 
Ctrl-V block/visual and a script. It's nice but I have to admit I resort to 
something a bit more crude. I create my template line with some unique string 
such as "xxx" to be replaced by the numeric sequence. I then duplicate that 
using normal vi commands like 100p (to put in a hundred copies of the template 
line, for example). Then I simply use something like !} (filter from here 
through the end of the paragraph) and type is a moderately ugly command like:

>
    awk '{sub(/xxx/,n++);print}'
<

as the filter (assuming I want to start with zero). More tedious versions are 
easily concocted using things like:

>
    awk 'BEGIN {n=100};{sub(/xxx/,n-=3);print}'
<

to do things like count down from 100 by threes. Thankfully I rarely have 
occasion to need this sort of thing for more than a half dozen lines where 
it's generally easier to just type such things by hand. Otherwise I'd save the 
specifics to a short script and possibly map the filtering to another macro 
like the g# shown above.

A couple of odd vim specific bindings that appear in other tips are Ctrl-A 
and Ctrl-X (VimTip 30 and partially duplicated in VimTip 287, and mentioned in 
passing in VimTip 305). These find the number nearest to the cursor and 
increment or decrement it respectively. I've never used that and will probably 
never quite remember it when I would and will probably never quite remember it 
when I would.

Numbering seems to be popular subject, and this makes for a nice article or 
commentary on various related tips. It's a pity that the linking format wasn't 
used in the tip. I've collected all of the references above and included them

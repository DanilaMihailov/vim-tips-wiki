==============================================================================

When using

>
    :set number
<

to show line numbers, your column alignment can be broken. However when 
you're in a window that supports it, the width of the window can be changed 
and as long as you've got enough screen real-estate to accommodate the extra 
columns your column alignment can be retained.

Add this to your vimrc file:

>
    function! Toggle_num()
      if !exists("g:grow")
        let g:grow = 8
      endif
      set number!
      if &number
        exec "set columns+=" . g:grow
      else
        exec "set columns-=" . g:grow
      endif
    endfunction
    map <M-n> :call Toggle_num()<CR>
<

So each time you use META-n, line numbers will be toggled and the appropriate 
number of columns will be added or removed from your vim window.

As of Vim 7.0, it's possible to change the line number column width using the 
numberwidth option. Of course, it doesn't really make sense now to always 
grow/shrink by 8 if numberwidth is set to, say, 4. So, an easy fix would be to 
change the line:

>
    let g:grow = 8
<

into:

>
    let g:grow = &numberwidth
<

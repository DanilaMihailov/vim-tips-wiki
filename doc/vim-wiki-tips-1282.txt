==============================================================================

If you use SubVersion for version control (http://subversion.tigris.org 
[http://subversion.tigris.org]) you will naturally already have set your 
EDITOR environment variable to 'vim' or 'gvim -f' so you can write commit 
messages in Vim. But you will also want to view the diff so you can write 
sensible comments in the log. Opening the diff manually is tedious, so here is 
a mapping for the F9 key:

>
    map <F9> :new<CR>:read !svn diff<CR>:set syntax=diff buftype=nofile<CR>gg
<

This opens a new buffer, reads the SVN diff, sets syntax highlighting and 
tells Vim not to save the buffer, and places the cursor at the top. Since the 
buffer won't be saved, you may quit using `:wqa` when you're finished writing 
the commit message.

COMMENTS                                                   *vwt-1282-comments*

See script#90 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90] for VCS 
integration with Vim.

Add this line to your .bashrc (or the startup script for your shell):

>
    export SVN_EDITOR='vim -c "4,\$!cut -c-5 --complement | xargs svn diff --no-diff-deleted -x --ignore-eol-style" -c "set syntax=diff" +0'
<

Or for a separate window:

>
    export SVN_EDITOR='\
                    vim -c "4,\$y" \
                    -c "below new" \
                    -c "put" \
                    -c "set syntax=diff buftype=nofile nowrap nobackup previewwindow bufhidden=delete" \
                    -c "silent execute \"%!cut -c-5 --complement | xargs svn diff --no-diff-deleted -x --ignore-eol-style\" | redraw" \
                    -c "wincmd k" +0'
<

Replace `below new` with `vnew` for a vertical split.

I find the 'gvimdiff' bash script here 
http://yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/Subversion.html#GDIFF 
[http://yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/Subversion.html#GDIFF] works great for diff'ing 
single files. (Compare your current local copy with the original copy you 
checked out).

==============================================================================

You can get fast access to read Vim's help by writing a small script. This 
can be particularly helpful if you have written your own documentation using 
Vim's help file type.

SUGGESTION 1                                            *vtw-265-suggestion-1*

>
    #!/bin/bash
    vim -c "help $1" -c only
<

Now name it, for example, `vih` and from the command line:

>
    $ vih makeprg
<

SUGGESTION 2                                            *vtw-265-suggestion-2*

Make an alias or shortcut to the command:

>
    gvim -c ":h MyKeyWord" -c :only
<

This will open gvim, jump to your help text in help mode and close all the 
rest. You only see your help text, just what you wanted to read.

FROM 200904 TIP (NOW REMOVED)          *vtw-265-from-200904-tip-(now-removed)*

Sometimes you may want to start Vim to look at a specific help page. I have 
these two functions in my `~/.bashrc` for this purpose.

To open the help page for a given word from the command line:

>
    vimhelp()
    {
      view -c "help $1" -c on -c "au! VimEnter *"
    }
<

and the same with helpgrep (you need the command Vim, not view because of the 
quickfix window)

>
    vimhelpgrep()
    {
      vim -c "helpgrep $1" -c on -c copen -c "au! VimEnter *"
    }
<

Now you can invoke the function with your search and Vim opens the desired 
help page. With the `;vimhelpgrep` function it opens an additional quickfix 
window and goes to the first hit.

TO DO
    - The two commands above include `"au! VimEnter *"` which removes all VimEnter 
      autocommands. 
    - That is probably to remove the effect of something in the author's vimrc, but 
      is not required in general. 
    - Think about whether to remove it, or perhaps replace with something like: 


view -u '$VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim' -c "help $1" -c only

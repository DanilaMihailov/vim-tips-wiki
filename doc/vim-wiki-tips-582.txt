==============================================================================

To easily save the current file, while keeping it open, use a mapping in your 
vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    noremap <Leader>s :update<CR>
<

With the default leader key, just press \s to save any changes to the current 
file. If the buffer has not been modified since the last save, the file is not 
written.

On many Windows systems, the file mswin.vim is sourced when Vim starts. In 
that case, Ctrl-S is mapped to :update, so the above mapping is not necessary 
(press Ctrl-S to save).

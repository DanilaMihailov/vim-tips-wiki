Here are some recommendations for fonts to use in gvim, particularly for 
writing programs.

In console Vim, it is easiest to just change your whole console's font to 
what suits you best. Just do a search for "<Windows/Ubuntu/etc> change console 
font".

TO DO
    - Should probably have separate tips for Linux and Windows font 
      recommendations, or at least make it clearer what works where. 
    - Every font should have a screenshot and note if it is free or commercial. 


PROGGY                                                        *vtw-914-proggy*

Proggy Clean font from http://www.dafont.com/proggy-clean.font 
[http://www.dafont.com/proggy-clean.font]

Using gvim with gtk2, I had a problem installing Proggy Clean. I couldn't get 
the pcf font registered by freetype/fontconfig. The result was that I could 
select Proggy Clean via "xfontsel", but not with the gtk2 font selector. A gtk 
build probably would have worked.

Anyway, the ttf font works fine. Just copy ProggyCleanTT.ttf to ~/.fonts and 
run "fc-cache" once. This should work on every Unix system with fontconfig 
installed.

Then start gvim and and choose the font, or insert this in your .gvimrc:

>
    set guifont=ProggyCleanTT\ 12
<

The 12pt size is necessary for a good look. On OS X, you need to set 15pt.

If you use ProggyCleanTT in gvim and the top of the font looks like garbage, 
with missing pieces, it is because you have the new freetype hinting turned 
on. Proggy is not hinted properly.

NEEP                                                            *vtw-914-neep*

I prefer the Neep programming font created by Jim Knoble. Get the 
jmk-x11-fonts package from http://nikolas.us.to/jmkfonts/ 
[http://nikolas.us.to/jmkfonts/]

It differentiates between a zero and the letter "O" and looks really nice. I 
use it for programming on a 1600x1200 screen.
    - On Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install xfonts-jmk` 
    - On Gentoo: `emerge x11fonts-jmk` 


Once you have installed the font you should put a line like this in your 
.gvimrc file:

>
    set guifont=Neep\ 18
<

You may also need to enable bitmap fonts and rebuild the font cache. On 
Ubuntu:

>
    rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf
    fc-cache -f -v
<

ZEVV-PEEP                                                  *vtw-914-zevv-peep*

I've been using Neep, but the characters are too small on a new laptop with a 
high resolution screen (1920x1200 at 15.4"). Zevv-peep is a variation on Neep 
for hires screens. X11 (Linux) and Windows variants are available 
athttp://zevv.nl/play/code/zevv-neep/ [http://zevv.nl/play/code/zevv-neep/]

Design considerations
    - Clean, avoid clutter. 
    - Very clear distinction between similar characters like `0 O o` and `i I l 1 
      |`. 
    - Suitable for light text on a dark background. 
    - Not too densely packed to allow a good separation between characters.

BITSTREAM VERA (TRUE TYPE)                *vtw-914-bitstream-vera-(true-type)*

Free from http://www.gnome.org/fonts/ [http://www.gnome.org/fonts/]

The sans serif mono spaced version of this font is clean and legible down to 
6 points on Mac OS X with a 110 dpi display.

Nearly all of my programming is via vim through an iTerm (Mac) or konsole 
(FreeBSD/Linux) terminal window. In the rare instances I use gvim the font has 
performed as expected.

Sans serif and serif fonts with variable spacing are also included.

Bitstream Vera Sans Mono at 11 point (Mac OS X): 
[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/vim/images/e/ef/Bitstreamverasans11.png/revision/latest?cb=20091218194137]

DejaVu Sans Mono looks identical to Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, and has more 
international characters. See the comments section for links.

GOHU                                                            *vtw-914-gohu*

Gohu is a free (under WTFPL) pixmap font available in PCF and BDF. It is 
extremely legible and unambiguous in both 11 and 14 px sizes.

UW TTYP0                                                    *vtw-914-uw-ttyp0*

UW ttyp0 is a free bitmap font family with about 3000 Unicode characters, 
including a number of stylistic variants that can be selected at installation 
time (plain, dotted or slashed zeroes, straight or curly quotes, visible or 
invisble NBSP, etc.). Sizes range from 6x11 to 11x22 px in regular and bold; 
for some sizes there is also an italic version. Currently only BDF/PCF (the 
X11 bitmap format) is supported; if you need another format, you'll have to 
convert it yourself. (I won't comment on the quality; as the author I'm 
obviously biased :-)

Update: Starting with version 1.1, UW ttyp0 also supports Powerline 
[https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline].

Creep is a free font based on the proggy tiny fonts but even smaller (4x9 
pixels).Since it is created using gbdfed, currently only BDF format is 
available, but thereare instructions on how to convert it for use in other 
formats.

OPENDYSLEXIC MONO                                  *vtw-914-opendyslexic-mono*

From the Web site:After a very short time getting used to the unusual appearance of this typeface, I found it extremely easy to read even at smaller sizes. I also felt like reading went more quickly and with less effort.



OpenDyslexic is available in the repositories of Ubuntu, Debian Sid, Fedora, 
Arch, and Mageia, and for download at http://opendyslexic.org/

    - Microsoft Consolas is an epic programming font. Obviously looks best with 
      ClearType but can be made to look decent under Xorg. To use Consolas on gvim

COMMENTS                                                    *vtw-914-comments*

I don't like any of these fonts on hires screens. They are too small on a 
1600x1200 panel. Normally I use Lucida Console 12 pt.

==============================================================================

On Windows, I use the Terminal font at 6 pts. However, it's a DOS font and 
that makes non English letters display all wrong. But I use it anyway because 
it maximizes my screen usage.

==============================================================================

How about the common 7x14-ISO8859-1 font? The only thing I'd change is to 
replace the zero with a slashed one (using FontForge). 
http://www.ank.com.ar/fonts/ [http://www.ank.com.ar/fonts/]

==============================================================================

My favorite fonts are 10x20/X and fixedsys/Windows, always clear and crisp.

==============================================================================

As has been noted, sometimes font size 16 is better for Proggy Clean.

On a Linux system, it can be useful to tell fontconfig to turn off 
antialiasing for specific fonts. Just create a file named `.fonts.conf` in 
your home directory with the following content:

>
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
    <fontconfig>
      <match target="font">
        <test qual="any" name="family">
          <string>ProggyCleanTT</string>
        </test>
        <edit name="antialias" mode="assign">
          <bool>false</bool>
        </edit>
      </match>
    </fontconfig>
<

==============================================================================

The proggy ttf didn't work well for me on FC3. Characters weren't scaled 
smoothly and looked jagged.

I instead prefer these Microsoft TrueType 
fonts:http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-fedora-fc3.html#ttf 
[http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-fedora-fc3.html#ttf]

Install the rpm and then use andale mono. They look lovely and are scaled and 
smoothed perfectly.

>
    set guifont=Andale\ Mono\ 9

==============================================================================

I've been using a monospace font (not necessarily programming-oriented 
though) called Inconsolata, available here 
[http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html].

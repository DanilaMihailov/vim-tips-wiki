When working with gvim, I like to "tear off" the buffermenu to keep track of 
my open buffers.

You can do this very quickly by hitting: Alt-b Enter

The floating buffermenu will be positioned at your mouse cursor.

You can also automate this with the following in your vimrc file:

>
    au VimEnter * :te Buffers
<

To open a file in a new buffer instead of opening a new window every time:
    - When opening files in Windows Explorer, read VimTip1003 |vwt-1003| Open files with existing Gvim window in Windows.
    - When opening files in Cygwin, add this to your .bashrc: alias vi='gvim --remote-silent'
    - When opening files in a command-prompt window, add this to your doskey configuration: vi=gvim --remote-silent $*


When working in Vim, I recomend you use the minibuffer explorer: 
minibufexpl.vim : Elegant buffer explorer - takes very little screen space

Except the hidden buffers don't show up. Try editing a directory, quickly it 
will get lost and not be visible in the buffer list. Example:

>
    :e .
    :e /etc
    :e /usr
<

==============================================================================

The format of the window title in Vim 5.x (well, at least for 5.7,.8, for 
Win32) used to be VIM - <full filename with path>. It's not in the win32 
binary of 6.0an that I found. I want my old way back.

Turns out, all that it takes to get it back is

>
    :set title titlestring=VIM\ -\ %F "make sure that the window caption setting is turned on and set caption to Vim 5.x style
<

Oh, however, one thing I did like about the 6.0 style is that it puts the 
word "help" in the title when the current buffer is a help file; so, I just 
tacked %h to my titlestring giving:

>
    :set title titlestring=VIM\ -\ %F\ %h "make sure that the window caption setting is turned on and set caption to Vim 5.x style
<

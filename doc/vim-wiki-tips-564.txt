==============================================================================

I have had a problem when using the mousewheel for scrolling. I occasionally 
press the wheel and it pastes text in the clipboard's "*" register at the 
place where the scroll wheel was pressed accidentally. This has been a 
constant irritation.

The workaround is documented at :help <MiddleMouse> |<>|, which includes the 
following information.

If you have a scrollwheel and often accidentally paste text, you can use 
these mappings to disable the pasting with the middle mouse button:

>
    :map <MiddleMouse> <Nop>
    :imap <MiddleMouse> <Nop>
<

To revert to the original setting for middle button click:

>
    :unmap <MiddleMouse>
    :iunmap <MiddleMouse>
<

While at it, take care also of 2-MiddleMouse, 3-MiddleMouse and (oh, 
humanity!) 4-MiddleMouse (that's for middle double clicks and triple and ...).

Alternatively, instead of simply ignoring it, make it the same as a left 
click with:

>
    noremap <MiddleMouse> <LeftMouse>
<

Also with noremap!, and the whole 2-,3-,etc. list above.

==============================================================================

These tips are helpful in stopping an accidental *single* click, but two or 
more clicks in same location (such as the button being pressed on by a book) 
will still cause a paste to occur. Anyone know why?

The solution is to add the following as well, to handle double-click, 
triple-click, and quadruple-click:

>
    :map <2-MiddleMouse> <Nop>
    :imap <2-MiddleMouse> <Nop>
    :map <3-MiddleMouse> <Nop>
    :imap <3-MiddleMouse> <Nop>
    :map <4-MiddleMouse> <Nop>
    :imap <4-MiddleMouse> <Nop>
<

==============================================================================

I find it easier to hold down the Ctrl key since I have nothing mapped to 
Ctrl-Middle. And then the middle mouse button still works according to my 
creaky old X-windows-originated intuitions.

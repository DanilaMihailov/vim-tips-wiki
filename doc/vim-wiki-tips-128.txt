==============================================================================

If you use Vim on Windows, but wish you had some of those nifty UNIX 
command-line tools, there are several places you can find them. The best-known 
is probably Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/ [http://www.cygwin.com/]), a 
comprehensive Linux-like environment that includes a large collection of the 
familiar UNIX commands.

Cygwin can be overkill if you just want a command or two, however. Here are 
some other options:
    -  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32 [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32]
    -  http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ [http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/]
    -  http://www.openetwork.com/berk.html [http://www.openetwork.com/berk.html]


A web search for windows unix utilities 
[http://www.google.com/search?q=windows+unix+utilities&btnG=Search] will 
uncover plenty of others.

Of course, if all you need is grep 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Find_in_files_within_Vim] or sort, don't forget 
that Vim now has built-in versions of both.

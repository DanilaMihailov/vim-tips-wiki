==============================================================================

I use CTRL+L to search php.net for the term under my cursor. The key mapping 
goes like this:

>
    nmap ^L :!lynx -accept_all_cookies http://us2.php.net/^R^W\#function.^R^W<CR>
<

Remember to use CTRL+V CTRL+L to get the ^L and CTRL+V CTRL+R to get the ^R, 
etc.

My workflow causes me to do most of my PHP development directly on a Unix 
server over an SSH connection. So, instead of switching from my terminal app 
to my web browser to search php.net, I like having a single keystroke to do 
it.

The ^R^W inserts the word under the cursor into the command area. You can use 
this is many other handy key mappings. The \#func... is to tell lynx to jump 
to an anchor tag, since all php.net manual pages have an anchor tag named in 
the form function.{functionName} (and the # is escaped as \# since Vim what to 
do a path substitution.) I should also note that the anchor part will only 
work if what you search for a) is a function and not a language construct, or 
a reference term b) does not contain an underscore. It will still load the 
page, but you will have to scroll past all of the navigation manually.

Also, use Q to quit lynx instead of just q to avoid the confirmation.

==============================================================================

You can also use the browser plugin script#1053 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1053] to view this as a Vim 
buffer (and use links, etc).

I remapped gu ('go URL') to bring up w3m:

>
    nmap gu :!w3m ^R^A<CR>
<

==============================================================================

This was my implementation (not as nice as the gu map):

>
    " opening a text based web browser from link under the cursor
    " Must be at the beginning of the URL text
    " yW - yanks the WORD
    " :!w3m <C-R>* - Executes the w3m text browser with contents of the unnamed register
    nmap ,www yW:!w3m <C-R>*<CR>
<

But after testing this one works much better:

>
    nmap gu :!w3m <C-R><C-A><CR>
<

==============================================================================

Following the normal steps of running "./configure" and "make" to build Vim 
on an HP-UX 10.20 will result in Vim being linked with the termlib library. 
This library does not support certain termcap capability codes, such as the 
"Co" code used to query the number of colors supported by the terminal. 
Consequently, Vim will not display colors when used with a color terminal such 
as a color xterm.

One solution to this is to run the configure script with the 
"--with-tlib=curses" option, like this:

>
    ./configure --with-tlib=curses
<

This will cause Vim to be linked with the HP-UX curses library, which does 
support the color termcap capability codes.

Note that the xterm that comes standard with HP-UX 10.20 does not display 
color character attributes. To see colors when running Vim in a terminal 
window, you will also need to install a color terminal emulator such as a 
recent xterm.

Color Vim (6.2) with HP-UX and Putty:

Compile Vim with this option:

>
    ./configure --with-tlib=curses
<

In your Putty settings go to "Connection" and set the "Terminal-type string" 
to "dtterm".

Edit your .profile, and add

>
    export TERM=dtterm
<

Edit your .vimrc and add the line

>
    syntax on
<

You should now be have full color editing in Vim.

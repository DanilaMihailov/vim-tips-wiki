==============================================================================

This is just in case there's somebody else who likes to work in a maximized 
Vim window on a high resolution desktop. If you follow good coding practice 
and make sure your programs use only 80 characters in each row, have you 
noticed how much space lies unused on the right?

I find that the following settings keep me from ever seeing another 
horizontal split, unless I specifically ask for it.

>
    cabbrev split vsplit
    cabbrev hsplit split
    cabbrev sta vertical sta
    cabbrev help vertical help
    cabbrev new vnew
    cabbrev right botright
    " A more heavyweight solution for ^W^]
    function! ToggleSplit (dir)
      let currFname = bufname ("%")
      let old = winnr ()
      " Window navigation to ensure the correct window is 'last'.
      if (a:dir == "u")
        wincmd k
        let back="j"
      elseif (a:dir == "d")
        wincmd j
        let back="k"
      elseif (a:dir == "l")
        wincmd h
        let back="l"
      elseif (a:dir == "r")
        wincmd l
        let back="h"
      endif
      if (winnr () == old)
        echo "Ouch"
        return
      endif
      exec "wincmd " . back
      quit
      if (back == "j" || back == "k")
        let orientation = "vsplit"
      else
        let orientation = "split"
      endif
      if (back == "j" || back == "l")
        let dir = "below"
      else
        let dir = "above"
      endif
      exec dir . " " . orientation " " . currFname
    endfunction
    noremap ^W^] ^W^]:silent call ToggleSplit ("d")<CR>
<

Optional.

>
    set splitright
<

In which case the above mapping becomes:

>
    noremap ^W^] :set splitbelow<CR>^W^]:silent call ToggleSplit ("u")<CR>:set nosplitbelow<CR>
<

Or you could just

>
    set splitbelow
<

Very elegant and almost perfect, but it screws up if you want to run a 
command with ranges

>
    noremap : :vertical<Space>

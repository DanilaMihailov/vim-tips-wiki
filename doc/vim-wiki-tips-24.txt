==============================================================================

Vim provides syntax files that can provide syntax coloring or folding for 
certain types of files. This tip discusses how to change some features of the 
standard syntax files to suit a personal preference. Do not change any of the 
files distributed with Vim because such updates will be lost when Vim is 
updated. Instead, use the techniques discussed here.

DOCUMENTATION  *vwt-24-documentation*

Here are some pointers to the Vim documentation on syntax highlighting.
    - I want *.foo files to be highlighted like HTML files: :help  |new-filetype|
    - I want to define a syntax file for *.bar files. Read the above and also: :help  |mysyntaxfile|
    - I want to make a few changes to the existing syntax highlighting: :help  |mysyntaxfile-add|
    - I want to change some of the colors from their defaults. Again, read :help  |mysyntaxfile|


PYTHON TRIPLE-QUOTED COMMENTS  *vwt-24-python-triple-quoted-comments*

In Vim 7.3 the file vim73/syntax/python.vim provides syntax highlighting for 
Python files. That file (correctly) treats """...""" as a string and 
highlights it accordingly. If you prefer, instances of """...""" or '''...''' 
that start on the line following a line ending with a colon can be treated as 
a comment. To do that, create file python.vim in your "after" syntax directory 
as in the following. The next Python file you open should treat triple-quoted 
doc strings in functions as comments (assuming your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] includes commands like filetype indent 
plugin on and syntax on).

Add the following to file ~/.vim/after/syntax/python.vim (Unix) or 
$HOME/vimfiles/after/syntax/python.vim (Windows)—you may need to create the 
directories and the file.

>
    syn region pythonComment
          \ start=+\%(:\n\s*\)\@<=\z('''\|"""\)+ end=+\z1+ keepend
          \ contains=pythonEscape,pythonTodo,@Spell

CHANGING SYNCOLOR.VIM  *vwt-24-changing-syncolor.vim*

It is possible to replace Vim's syncolor.vim file to customise syntax 
highlighting. :help |syncolor| See Highlight special filetype docs 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Highlight_special_filetype_docs] which includes a 
comment that a syncolor.vim alternative is available here

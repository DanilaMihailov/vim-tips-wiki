==============================================================================

Sometimes one wants to create a unified patch from the file which is 
currently being edited. I have written a function that will create the patch 
and open it in a new buffer, so that it could possibly be further edited. In 
case the function cannot determine the unchanged reference file, it will ask 
the user to provide an alternative filename for diffing (by default it tries 
to open a file named like the current file with the suffix ".orig" appended.

It will create temporary files in case the current buffer is not modified or 
new. At the end it will delete the temporary files (but this works only on 
Linux).

For Windows this script relies on the command diff which must be in your path 
in order to be executed successfully. The diff command can be modified in the 
first line of the function.

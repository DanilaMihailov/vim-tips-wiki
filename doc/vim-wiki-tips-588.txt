==============================================================================

To sort lines based on a visually-selected column, use Visual Block Sorting 
[http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VISSORT]. It uses Piet 
Delport's Vim-based binary insertion sort and some Vim glue to provide 
visual-block sorts!

To enable it, put vissort.vim into your .vim/plugin directory.

To perform sorting with Vissort, based on a visual-block selection (Ctrl-v):

>
    :'<,'>Vissort
<

If you're using Vim 7.0 or later, vissort.vim will use Vim's internal sort 
command rather than the binary insertion sort script.

To sort a visually-selected block (without changing text outside the block), 
use Visual Block Commands 
[http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#VIS].

Look under "Visual Block Commands". The vis.vim plugin provides a command 
which allows other commands to be applied only to the visually selected block.

vis.vim can also be downloaded at script#1195 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1195].

To then perform sorting of just a visual-block (Ctrl-v):

>
    :'<,'>B !sort
<

Or, using Piet Delport's binary insertion sort:

>
    :'<,'>B Bisort
<

Of course, you can use Vim's internal sort if you're using Vim 7.0 or later, 
too:

>
    :'<,'>B sort
<

Examples: Original, visual-block select the central column

>
    one two three
    four five six
    seven eight nine
    ten eleven twelve
<

>
    :'<,'>Vissort
    seven eight nine
    ten eleven twelve
    four five six
    one two three
<

>
    :'<,'>B !sort
    one eight three
    four eleven six
    seven five nine
    ten two twelve
<

>
    :'<,'>B Bisort
    one eight three
    four eleven six
    seven five nine
    ten two twelve

COMMENTS  *vwt-588-comments*

vissort has been updated to version 3: it now has BlockSort() which permits 
one to sort blocks of text based on tags contained within them.

==============================================================================

For Windows users only: Visual blocking is done with Ctrl-q. Do not use the 
arrow key to make the block, use only h-j-k-l.

==============================================================================

The simple sample in the tip can be solved by native :sort command, no plugin 
required.

>
    :sort /\s\+/
<

and for the visual blocking condition, you need no plugin. If your Visuall 
Block start at visual column 7, without selecting it, just execute

>
    :sort /\%7v/
<

I have few plugins in my computer, for Vim is good enough!

Generally, visual block sorting can be done as following.

After selecting visual block, execute following command to sort on the 
selected text in the selected range:

>
    :'<,'>sort /\ze\%V/
<

If you want to keep the text outside of visual block unchanged, you need 
select or go Go to the last Visual selection and Yank it to a register. Then 
Undo the the sort made. Then just paste the unsorted data over the sorted 
data. Or just type:

>
    gvyugvp
<

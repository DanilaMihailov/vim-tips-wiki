==============================================================================

Use the :read command to insert a file, or the output from a system command, 
into the current buffer. Examples:

>
    :r foo.txt    Insert the file foo.txt below the cursor.
    :0r foo.txt   Insert the file foo.txt before the first line.
    :r !ls        Insert a directory listing below the cursor.
    :$r !pwd      Insert the current working directory below the last line.
<

On Windows, the last two commands would be:

>
    :r !dir
    :$r !cd

Don't know the path to perl (for #!/.../perl)?

    :r !which perl

I now no longer need to use "append system" code in my scripts. I used to use 
code like:

>
    call append(line("."), system(l:cmd))
<

And because this puts the entire results of the system command on a single 
line separated by ^@, I need to split the lines up:

>
    silent! exec "%s/\<CR>/\<CR>/g"
    silent! exec "%s/\<NL>/\<CR>/g"
<

The worst thing was when the results were really large (try running %s on a 
single 6Mb line... not pleasant)I can now just use

>
    exec "r !".l:cmd
<

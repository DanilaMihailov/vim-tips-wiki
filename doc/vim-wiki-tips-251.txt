==============================================================================

If you try to impose any sort of alignment on your preprocessor directives, 
rather than just starting them on column 0, this mapping will align the #endif 
'correctly' when you type '#en', start a new line, and bring you back to the 
correct alignment to edit code.

This tip is currently at -1/1 - I'm not sure why, since I use it a lot. In 
any case, here's an updated version that handles nested #if blocks.

I've stopped positioning the cursor on the next line because I found myself 
doing <Esc>dd too often.

In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to deal with code with such a high 
density of preprocessor directives as to make indenting them, and therefore 
this tip, useful.

==============================================================================

This would probably better implemented as an indentexpr (or an extension to 
an existing c++ indentexpr) instead of a map. (Although I'm not sure if you 
could use the same logic to do so.) But that would let you use the same logic

See proposal below to replace this with a redirect.

The question of using Vim for writing email messages with Vim on windows was 
raised many times.

Finally there is an elegant solution. At 
http://sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net/win32/ 
[http://sylpheed-claws.sourceforge.net/win32/]download 
`sylpheed-0.9.6claws.exe` and install.

Go to menu configuration -> Common preferences

Go to tab Other and fill something like

>
    c:\Progra~1\Vim\vim62b\gvim.exe -f "%s"
<

(depending on where your Vim is installed) as the the editor option

The -f option is very important so Vim does not fork.

You might also go to Compose tab and select Automatically launch an external 
editor.

Are you sure about the "-f" flag ? So far, I've never seen this flag do 
anything under Windows. That's why I use mutt compiled for cygwin with the 
win32 version of Vim.

You wrote "Finally there is an elegant solution", but there are many 
solutions: at random Mahogany http://mahogany.sf.net [http://mahogany.sf.net] 
(excellent one) or pine (great, ever great) or use Google.

==============================================================================

Let me get this right - you want me to switch to a whole new email client 
just so that I can change its default editor to something else. Not just Vim - 
*anything*. How is this a Vim tip, exactly??

==============================================================================

PC-Pine offers an external-editor-feature too.

==============================================================================

Look at script#1052 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1052] 
-- it can send, receive and organize emails from within Vim on Windows and 
Unix (but requires not only Vim with embedded Perl but also external Perl).

==============================================================================

See VimTip805 |vwt-805| for a general solution for Windows.

==============================================================================

I propose replacing this page with a redirect to tip 805: Use gvim as an 
external editor for Windows apps 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Use_gvim_as_an_external_editor_for_Windows_apps]. 
There is nothing useful here. Any comments? (I'm putting this in to see if 
that reminds me to find this later.) JohnBeckett

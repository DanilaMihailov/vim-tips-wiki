Suppose there's a colorscheme that you're pretty fond of, but hate one or two 
particular aspects about. For example, I love the "blue" colorscheme that 
ships with vim, but I find it's colors for the non-active status line to be 
unreadable. Here's how to create a colorscheme which extends "blue" without 
copying it to a new file and editing it.

In my ~/.vim/colors, I created a "my-blue.vim" file with these contents:

>
    "these lines are suggested to be at the top of every colorscheme
    hi clear
    if exists("syntax_on")
      syntax reset
    endif
    
    "Load the 'base' colorscheme - the one you want to alter
    runtime colors/blue.vim
    
    "Override the name of the base colorscheme with the name of this custom one
    let g:colors_name = "my-blue"
    
    "Clear the colors for any items that you don't like
    hi clear StatusLine
    hi clear StatusLineNC
    
    "Set up your new & improved colors
    hi StatusLine guifg=black guibg=white
    hi StatusLineNC guifg=LightCyan guibg=blue gui=bold
<

That's all there is to it.

If you want to create rules for a color terminal instead of a GUI, you would 
obviously use ctermfg, ctermbg, and cterm instead of guifg, guibg, and gui. If 
the only thing you don't like about a colorscheme is the lack of cterm 
support, then you can eliminate the "hi clear" statements and just apply the 
cterm statements. They will add or change any existing cterm color without 
modifying the gui definitions.

If the color scheme does not define colors for a cterm at all, then it is 
probably easier to use the CSApprox plugin 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390] to allow you to just 
use the GUI colorscheme directly, instead of trying to come up with 
replacement colors on your own.

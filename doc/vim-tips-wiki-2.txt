==============================================================================

While editing a file, you may want to open another file in the same 
directory. However, navigating to the file can be frustrating if it is not in 
the current directory.

Using one of the following snippets in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] will help open files while deep in the 
directory tree. An alternative would be to set the working directory to the 
current file |vtw-64|.

USING A COMMAND LINE ABBREVIATION    *vtw-2-using-a-command-line-abbreviation*

This method uses a command line abbreviation so `%%` expands to the full path 
of the directory that contains the current file.

>
    cabbr <expr> %% expand('%:p:h')
<

For example, while editing file `/some/path/myfile.txt`, typing `:e %%/` on 
the command line will expand to `:e /some/path/`. Then you can use completion 
(press Tab after typing the first few letters of a file name), or press Enter 
to browse the directory listing. Of course, this abbreviation works anywhere 
on the command line, so you can use it with `:cd`, `:grep` etc.

If your Vim does not support <expr> mappings, try using the expression 
register |"=| to extract the path instead:

>
    cabbr %% <C-R>=expand('%:p:h')<CR>
<

Note that you have to type a non-keyword character after `%%` in order to 
expand the abbreviation. For example, after typing `:e %%`, you could expand 
the abbreviation by typing `/` or by pressing Enter or Ctrl-].

USING A MAPPING                                        *vtw-2-using-a-mapping*

While editing file `/some/path/myfile.txt`, this method allows you to type 
`\e` (assuming the default backslash leader) to enter `:e /some/path/` on the 
command line. Again, you can use completion to enter a file name, or press 
Enter to browse the directory.

>
    nnoremap <Leader>e :e <C-R>=expand('%:p:h') . '/'<CR>
<

This method is less versatile than the command line abbreviation above 
|vtw-2-using-a-command-line-abbreviation|.

REFERENCES                                                  *vtw-2-references*
    - :help |cmdline-special| `%` on command line is replaced with current file 
      name 
    - :help |expand()| 
    - :help |filename-modifiers| explanation of '%:p:h' 


COMMENTS                                                      *vtw-2-comments*

CATEGORIES                                                        *vtw-2-cats*

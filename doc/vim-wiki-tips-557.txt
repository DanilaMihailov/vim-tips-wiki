==============================================================================

Suppose you want to open several files in Vim, but the names of the files to 
open are stored in a file, each file name on separate line. This is the case 
with Total Commander, when you open a program and pass %L as a parameter.

It is possible to do it like this:

>
    gvim "+gl/^/exec 'badd '.getline('.')" +bdel +nohls +"cd %:h" LISTFILE
<

where LISTFILE contains the list of file names to open.

Using Total Commander, I create new item in "start menu", and assign a 
shortcut, let's say CTRL+ALT+F4 to it. Set path\gvim.exe as a command.

This is what i put in a "parameters" section:

>
    "+gl/^/exec 'badd '.getline('.')" +bdel +nohls +"cd %%:h" %L
<

Then I can select several files, press CTRL+ALT+F4 and load all of them into 
my favourite text editor :)

Try:

>
    gvim -c ":args `type mylist`"
<

You can also use commands like the following, even on Windows:

>
    gvim *\2*\xx.txt
<

==============================================================================

Sometimes you get bugged with all the comments in your working file. With all 
the Fixes and Patches and previous comments, code looks miserable. I don't 
know whether there is any better way of getting rid of comments. This is not a 
generic tip that will work for all color settings. I don't know how I will get 
the background color of the currently active theme.

Anyone using Black background in Vim can use the following command:

>
    :hi Comment guifg=black
<

Anyone using White background can try this:

>
    :hi Comment guifg=white
<

COMMENTS                                                   *vtw-1072-comments*

For what it is worth, my preferred method to ignore comments is simply to 
fold them away. This way they are still easily accessible if I want, and I can 
leave comments that I want. However, the downside is (depending on your fold 
method, of course) it can be tedious to fold masses of comments.

==============================================================================

My personal view is that these sort of history comments have no place in the 
code. Comments should only be what the code does now. They should also never 
be hidden - if they are of so little use that they can be hidden then they 
should be deleted.

Of course changes should be commented, but these should be as part of the 
Source Code Control system as they are checked in, not an integral part of the 
code.

==============================================================================

Here is a small script which will work for all types of colors.

>
    if !exists("ccolor")
      let ccolor = 0
      let comment_fg = synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("Comment")), "fg")
      let comment_bg = synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("Comment")), "bg")
      let background = synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("Normal")), "bg")
      execute "highlight Comment guifg=" background
      execute "highlight Comment guibg=" background
      exit
    endif
    if ccolor == 0
      let ccolor = 1
      execute "highlight Comment guifg=" comment_fg
      execute "highlight Comment guibg=" comment_bg
    else
      let ccolor = 0
      let background = synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("Normal")), "bg")
      execute "highlight Comment guifg=" background
      execute "highlight Comment guibg=" background
    endif
    "check this comment
<

put this in some comment_color.vim

`:so comment_color.vim` will change shadow and unshadow comment, alternately.

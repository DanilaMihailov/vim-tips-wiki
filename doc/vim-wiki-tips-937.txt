==============================================================================

In addition to the existing techniques for searching Vim help pages, such as 
the built-in :helpgrep and other grep techniques such as using external 
grep/id-utils, here is another technique that you can use to quickly lookup 
help topics.

You are probably already aware that Vim creates tags to lookup help topics 
(using the :helptags command), and commands such as :tselect (or :ts in short) 
do work in the help windows (it is automatically scoped to only the tags files 
in your runtime doc directories). This other than providing a way to use 
familiar tag commands to lookup help topics (such as tag completion and using 
regex to lookup), allows us to take advantage of any tools that enhance the 
Vim built-in tag commands. I would like to show here one such tool that you 
can use.

This requires the tagselect.vim plugin script#1282 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1282] and its dependent 
plugins script#171 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=171] and 
script#197 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=197].

The plugin allows you execute a :tselect command and view the results in a 
new window. You can then use Vim's navigation (such as search) to find the tag 
you want and press Enter to jump to it. When used inside a help window, this 
naturally works on the help topics too. For example, say you want to view all 
the topics that have "shell" in their name. One way to do this is use tag 
completion

>
    :h shell<Tab>
<

and go one by one. But this is not easy as often you find tens, if not 
hundreds of matches for a keyword, so going through the list and using :tnext 
and :tprevious commands to navigate to other matching results is painful. But 
if you use the :Tselect command provided by the plugin, it becomes relatively 
simpler.

>
    :h
    :Tselect /.*shell.*
<

The above gives you the full matching results for all the topics containing 
"shell" in their names. You can try other regular expressions (see :help 
|tag-regexp|), but the above is probably the most useful, so you can create a 
command for it:

>
    :command! -nargs=+ -complete=tag Helpt :Tselect /.*<args>.*
<

You can put the above command definition in your vimrc. You can then say:

>
    :Helpt tag
<

The best part of this is that you will discover topics that you overlooked 
several times, including any help topics for plugins.

COMMENTS  *vwt-937-comments*

I prefer the following:

>
    :he shell<c-d>
<

That will show a list help topics with 'shell' in the name. From there it is 
a simple matter to see which help topic you want.

==============================================================================

You can search help without plugins:

>
    :helpgrep shell
    :copen
<

==============================================================================

I also use <ctrl-d> and it completely satisfies me. Could author give any 
real example which shows that using of that technique gives some noticeable 
advantages over <ctrl-d>?

==============================================================================

Using <C-D> solution is unwieldy if there are too many hits (I also use this 
solution though I failed to mention this in my original post because <Tab> 
does the same as <C-D> for me as I have 'wildmode' set to "list:full"). Ok, 
here are the benefits I want to point out with the solution using 
tagselect.vim:
    - looking up the matching topic
    - with <C-D> you need to do it visually (it is not that easy to do random searching using your eyes),
    - with tagselect.vim, you can use the vim search.

    - selecting a topic
    - with <C-D> you need to back off the partial pattern (<C-W> or something like that) and retype the *exact* topic name that you looked up.
    - with tagselect.vim, you can just press Enter

    - Once you select a topic out of say, 100 matching topics, how would you look up and jump to another one?
    - with <C-D>, you need to repeat the :h command with <C-D> etc.
    - with tagselect.vim, you would use :Ts command (with no arguments) and repeat the search and select procedure.

    - Using tagselect.vim also allows you to view the filename to narrow down the topic you want.
    - Using :ts or :Ts allows you to specify any regular expression, but :h command always assumes substring.


The above may not make sense to someone whose needs and usage patterns are 
different than mine, but I added the tip just in case someone is likely to 
find it useful as I did.

For the other reader who pointed out the :helpgrep, I already mentioned using 
this command as an option. Using :cwindow is a good alternative to do search 
followed by :helpgrep, but this should usually show too many results, which 
may or not be better (and this shows the actual line as context too).

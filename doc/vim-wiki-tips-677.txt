==============================================================================

This insert-mode map is fairly easy. It will save a lot of keystrokes for 
opening and closing braces when programming. It works best with cindent on 
(:set cindent) since vim will automatically indent to the right tabstop. I 
mapped it to insert-mode Ctrl-F.

Example:

>
    int main() Ctrl-F
<

will produce:

>
    int main() {
        |
    }
<

insert the following in your vimrc file

>
    " Opening and closing braces
    imap <C-F> {<CR>}<C-O>O

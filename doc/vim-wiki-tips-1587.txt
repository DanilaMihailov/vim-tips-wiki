==============================================================================

In gvim, you can change the font using the Edit menu, Select Font. An 
alternative is to enter the command:

>
    :set guifont=*
<

Once you have a font you like, you want to make it the default in the future. 
Do

>
    :set guifont?
<

and Vim will display something like

>
    guifont=Lucida_Console:h11
<

Alternatively, enter the following to insert the current font setting into 
the buffer:

>
    :put =&guifont
<

Now put a line in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] to set 
guifont to this value, like this:

>
    if has('gui_running')
      set guifont=Lucida_Console:h11
    endif
<

If there is a space in the font name, such as

>
    guifont=Monospace 10
<

it is necessary to escape the space

>
    set guifont=Monospace\ 10
<

The following example shows how vimrc can include settings for more than one 
operating system, on the assumption that the vimrc file is the same on more 
than one system. The example also shows how 'guioptions', a color scheme, and 
the window size can be set.

>
    if has('gui_running')
      set guioptions-=T  " no toolbar
      colorscheme elflord
      set lines=60 columns=108 linespace=0
      if has('gui_win32')
        set guifont=DejaVu_Sans_Mono:h10:cANSI
      else
        set guifont=DejaVu\ Sans\ Mono\ 10
      endif
    endif
<

CONSOLE VIM  *vwt-1587-console-vim*

Console Vim uses whatever font the console/terminal is using. Changing the 
font in your terminal is done differently depending on your system and the 
terminal in use. Consult the documentation or manpages for your terminal, or 
do a web search for how to change the font in your chosen terminal. Vim cannot 
use a different font than the rest of the terminal.

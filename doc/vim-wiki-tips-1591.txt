==============================================================================

Omni completion provides smart autocompletion for programs. When invoked, the 
text before the cursor is inspected to guess what might follow. A popup menu 
offers word completion choices that may include struct and class members, 
system functions, and more. A similar feature in Microsoft Visual Studio is 
known as IntelliSense.

OVERVIEW  *vwt-1591-overview*

Omni completion is not usually enabled by default. To turn on omni 
completion, add the following to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    filetype plugin on
    set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete
<

Various programming languages are supported in Vim 7. For many languages such 
as SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, omni completion will work out of the 
box. Other languages such as C and PHP will also take advantage of a tags file 
- if one exists. Omni completion using a tags file will complete the names of 
defined constants, functions, classes and other names from included and other 
external files. Omni completion scripts can be written to support other 
languages, and to customize behavior. :help |new-omni-completion| :help 
|compl-omni|

When generating a tags file, Exuberant Ctags [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/] 
should be used. Windows users need to install a recent version of Exuberant 
Ctags [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/] (Ctags 5.7, released September 2007, or 
newer, is recommended). :help |ft-c-omni|

USING OMNI COMPLETION  *vwt-1591-using-omni-completion*

To use omni completion, type <C-X><C-O> while open in Insert mode.If matching 
names are found, a pop-up menu opens which can be navigated using the <C-N> 
and <C-P> keys.

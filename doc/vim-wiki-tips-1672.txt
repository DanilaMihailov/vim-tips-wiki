==============================================================================

This tip explains how to search for a path of the form /abc/def/ghi/ without 
needing to manually escape each slash (using the normal / command would 
require the example path to be entered as \/abc\/def\/ghi\/). In addition, a 
command is shown to allow searching for text while treating all special search 
characters as just text (so you can easily search for text like a*b or ^ab 
without needing to enter a\*b or \^ab).

REVERSE SEARCHING  *vwt-1672-reverse-searching*

If searching backwards with "?", any slashes in the pattern need not be 
escaped. After searching backwards, you can press n to continue searching in 
the same direction (backwards), or N to search in the reverse direction 
(forwards). Or, you can search forwards with / and no pattern, which will use 
the previous pattern:

>
    ?/abc/def/ghi/
    /
<

Now, pressing n will search forwards for the next occurrence, and N will 
search backwards.

SEARCHING FOR SLASH AS NORMAL TEXT  *vwt-1672-searching-for-slash-as-normal-text*

The following alternative commands allow searching for text which includes a 
slash, with no need to escape each slash in the command. Other special 
characters have their usual meaning (for example, the pattern ^abc finds abc, 
but only at the start of a line).

Place the following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    command! -nargs=1 Ss let @/ = <q-args>
<

to define a new command Ss which allows easy searching for text which 
includes slashes. For example:

This alternative sets the search register and enables search highlighting 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Highlight_all_search_pattern_matches] so hits are 
immediately visible:

>
    command! -nargs=1 Ss let @/ = <q-args>|set hlsearch
<

This alternative sets the search register and searches for that text:

>
    command! -nargs=1 Ss let @/ = escape(<q-args>, '/')|normal! /<C-R>/<CR>
<

In the last example, <C-R>/ represents Ctrl-R then / which enters the value 
of the search register into the search command (the first /). The escape() 
function is required to prefix any slashes with a backslash because the text 
is used in a / command (where a search pattern is terminated by an unescaped 
slash). Since the command performs an actual search, the pattern is placed in 
the search history [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Using_command-line_history].

SEARCHING FOR ALL CHARACTERS AS NORMAL TEXT  *vwt-1672-searching-for-all-characters-as-normal-text*

Place the following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    command! -nargs=1 SS let @/ = '\V'.escape(<q-args>, '\')
<

to define a new command SS which allows easy searching for text which 
includes characters that normally have a special meaning in a search pattern. 
For example:

This alternative sets the search register and enables search highlighting so 
hits are immediately visible:

>
    command! -nargs=1 SS let @/ = '\V'.escape(<q-args>, '\')|set hlsearch
<

This alternative sets the search register and searches for that text:

>
    command! -nargs=1 SS let @/ = '\V'.escape(<q-args>, '/\')|normal! /<C-R>/<CR>
<

For example, with the last alternative, the command :SS ^abc/def\[ghi\] would 
find text ^abc/def\[ghi\] (the same text that was entered).

MANUALLY ASSIGNING THE SEARCH  *vwt-1672-manually-assigning-the-search*

If you have copied a path like /abc/def/ghi/ into the clipboard, you can 
search for that text with these commands:

If the path has been copied into the default yank register, use this:

Or, just set the text directly:

SUBSTITUTING WITH ALTERNATIVE DELIMITERS  *vwt-1672-substituting-with-alternative-delimiters*

The :substitute command accepts any punctuation character to delimit the 
search pattern, not just /. For example, assuming the path being searched for 
does not contain a comma, the following command could be entered:

>
    :s,/abc/def/ghi/,,en
<

The e flag means no error is reported if the pattern is not found in the 
current line, and n means the pattern is counten with no change occurring. 
After entering the command, press n to search forwards or N to search 
backwards.

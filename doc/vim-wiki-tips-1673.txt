==============================================================================

This tip explains how to download the source for Vim, then build a Vim 
executable, and install it on a Windows system. Optionally, Vim can be 
compiled with a Python 2.x or 3.x interface. The build is performed using the 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express (free). See Building Vim 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Building_Vim] for related information, including 
how to download Vim if you do not want to build it yourself.

Administrative privileges are not required for the steps in this tip, except 
when installing:
    - Python (if Python is wanted). 
    - Mercurial (if using the "needs admin rights" installer to make Mercurial 
      available for all users). 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio. 


PYTHON INTERFACE  *vwt-1673-python-interface*

This tip shows how to build Vim with or without a Python interface. Python is 
optional, and not needed for normal Vim.

Vim can be compiled to provide an interface so that Vim scripts can be 
written in Python, and so that Vim commands like :py print 2**1024 work. If an 
interface between Vim and Python is wanted, Python needs to be installed 
separately, and Vim needs to be compiled with support for the version of 
Python used. Vim can be configured to work with Python 2.x or 3.x or both 
(although the 3.x configuration is newer and less tested).

To determine whether a particular installation of Vim supports Python, enter 
the command :version in Vim. If the output includes +python/dyn (with "+") 
then Python 2.x is supported, and the DLL file specified in the link command 
shown in the output will be dynamically loaded if needed. If the output 
includes +python3/dyn then Python 3.x is supported, and the Python 3 DLL file 
shown in the output will be dynamically loaded if needed. On Windows, dynamic 
loading is standard with the result that although Python needs to be installed 
to build Vim, the resulting Vim executable can be run on a system with no 
Python (Vim would work, but attempting to use the Python interface would 
fail).

REQUIRED TOOLS  *vwt-1673-required-tools*

The following tools may be installed to download and build the Vim source.

Python programming language (optional)
For example, install using "Python 2.7.2 Windows Installer (Windows binary -- does not include source)" from here.
This is not needed by Mercurial or Vim. Mercurial uses file python26.dll that is included in the standard Mercurial installer for Windows.
Vim can be built to provide an interface so that Vim scripts can be written in Python, and so that Vim commands like :py print 2**1024 work. If that is wanted, Python needs to be installed before building Vim.

Mercurial version control system (hg command)
For example, install using "Mercurial-2.0 (32-bit msi) needs admin rights to install" from here.
Mercurial recommends that the Windows indexing service and virus scanners be configured to exclude directories containing a repository or a working copy. This advice can probably be ignored, but a virus scanner may lock a file after it is written so any program (such as Mercurial) which writes many files then attempts to operate on them, could fail.

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express (part of Visual Studio)
Free download here.
The product can be downloaded, installed, and the Visual Studio GUI run for thirty days (or indefinitely if registered online with Microsoft). Registration is not required to build Vim because only the command line tools are used. Administrative privileges are required to install and to register.

To install Python or Mercurial, download the wanted setup program and run it.

It is not needed for Vim, but if you want to run Python in a command prompt 
window, you need to first adjust the PATH, for example:

>
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27
    python
<

To install Visual Studio, download the setup program (see link above). Setup 
is a small program which downloads components as required. As an 
administrator, run setup and perform these steps:
    - Accept or clear "send information about my setup experiences to Microsoft". 
    - Agree to license. 
    - Accept or clear option to install Microsoft Silverlight. 
    - Accept default install location. 
    - Restart computer when prompted. 
    - After restarting, log on as an administrator; setup will automatically 
      continue running. 
    - When finished, setup prompts that Windows Update should be used. 
    - Use Windows Update to install security updates; restart when prompted. 
    - Later, you can run the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express" GUI and use the 
      Help menu, "Register Product" to register within 30 days. 


REQUIRED DIRECTORIES AND FILES  *vwt-1673-required-directories-and-files*

The following directories will be used as examples:

Directory \current\build\vim
Will hold Vim source and runtime files as downloaded using Mercurial.
Also used to build Vim.
Replace "current" with whatever you like, however if the path contains spaces, more care will be needed.

Directory \myname\bin
Will hold some files used when building, as well as the Vim executable and runtime files used to run Vim. The intention is that myname holds programs or other files that are wanted on several different computers. Make a master copy on one computer, then copy the master to other computers. No installation will be required on the other computers, apart from adjusting the PATH. The bin directory can contain any simple tools that do not need installation, although for this tip it will only contain two batch files. The Vim files will be installed in a subdirectory.
Replace "myname" with whatever you like, however if the path contains spaces, more care will be needed.

In a command prompt window, enter the following to make the current and build 
directories (the vim subdirectory will be created later).

>
    md \current\build
<

Enter the following to make the myname and bin directories.

>
    md \myname\bin
<

Create file \myname\bin\vimconfig.cmd with contents as follows, if a Python 
interface is not wanted:

>
    :: Set environment for wanted options before building Vim.
    set GUI=yes
<

Alternatively, use the following contents if a Python interface is wanted 
(this text assumes a default install of Python 2.7):

>
    :: Set environment for wanted options before building Vim.
    set GUI=yes
    set DYNAMIC_PYTHON=yes
    set PYTHON=C:/Python27
    set PYTHON_VER=27
<

If installing with Python 3 and above, replace PYTHON with PYTHON3:

>
    :: Set environment for wanted options before building Vim.
    set GUI=yes
    set DYNAMIC_PYTHON3=yes
    set PYTHON3=C:/Python32
    set PYTHON3_VER=32
<

Additional options could be:

>
    set NETBEANS=no
    set FEATURES=HUGE
    set CPUNR=i686
    set WINVER=0x500
    set OLE=yes
<

More information on the build options is available here 
|http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/howto/win32-compile/Vim-Compile-Win32-HOWTO/compiling.html|.

Create file \myname\bin\vimcopy.cmd with contents as follows:

>
    :: Copy any new Vim exe + runtime files to current install.
    @set SRC=C:\current\build\vim
    @set DST=C:\myname\bin\vim\vim73
    xcopy %SRC%\runtime %DST% /D /E /H /I /Y %*
    xcopy %SRC%\src\xxd\xxd.exe %DST%\* /D /Y %*
    xcopy %SRC%\src\GvimExt\gvimext.dll %DST%\* /D /Y %*
    xcopy %SRC%\src\*.exe %DST%\* /D /Y %*
<

VIM SOURCE AND RUNTIME FILES  *vwt-1673-vim-source-and-runtime-files*

The following sets build as the current directory, then downloads the entire 
Vim source and runtime files to a tree under the vim subdirectory (created by 
the hg command). This is required once only, to get started, and will take a 
few minutes.

>
    cd \current\build
    hg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim
<

In the future, changes to the Vim source and runtime files can be downloaded 
with the following.

>
    cd \current\build\vim
    hg pull -u
<

If you accidentally change some Vim source files, you can clean the source to 
discard your changes.

>
    cd \current\build\vim
    hg update -C
<

BUILDING VIM  *vwt-1673-building-vim*

After the initial clone (hg clone) or update (hg pull -u), the executable Vim 
programs can be built with the following.

>
    cd \current\build\vim\src
    msvc2010.bat
    \myname\bin\vimconfig.cmd
    nmake -f Make_mvc.mak
<

These commands use:
    - File \current\build\vim\src\msvc2010.bat supplied with Vim. This calls file 
      vsvars32.bat (installed with Visual Studio) to configure environment variables 
      to allow building at the command prompt. 
    - File \myname\bin\vimconfig.cmd (created in an earlier step) to configure 
      environment variables for the options wanted while building Vim. 
    - File nmake.exe (installed with Visual Studio) to compile and link Vim. 


The above builds programs gvim.exe (GUI Vim), vimrun.exe (to run external 
commands from Vim), and xxd.exe (to display binary files in hex 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Hex_dump]). If wanted, you can also build vim.exe 
(console Vim, to run in a command prompt window) with:

>
    cd \current\build\vim\src
    nmake -f Make_mvc.mak gui=no
<

If wanted, you can change the options used to build Vim (see Make_mvc.mak). 
However, the old build files must be "cleaned" (deleted, so the new build will 
not use a mixture of files from the old and new configurations). Clean with 
the following.

>
    cd \current\build\vim\src
    msvc2010.bat
    \myname\bin\vimconfig.cmd
    nmake -f Make_mvc.mak clean
<

CONFIGURING VIM  *vwt-1673-configuring-vim*

Vim is usually configured with a vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] 
file and with runtime files set by the user (in addition to the runtime files 
provided with Vim). Generally the user config files are under the $HOME 
directory. Vim sets its $HOME variable from the environment variable HOME, if 
defined, or, more commonly on Windows systems, by joining variables HOMEDRIVE 
and HOMEPATH.

By default, a user logged on as Myname on a Windows XP system will have 
C:\Documents and Settings\Myname as their $HOME directory. On some systems, 
that location can be changed by running lusrmgr.msc: display the Properties of 
the user; on the Profile tab, set "Home folder, Local path" to be any wanted 
directory (for example C:\myname).

In Vim, you can display the value of $HOME by entering:

>
    :echo $HOME
<

Create file $HOME/_vimrc with your preferred settings, for example:

>
    set nocompatible
    filetype indent plugin on
    syntax on
    set wildmenu wildmode=full
    set showcmd
    set ignorecase hlsearch incsearch
    set backspace=indent,eol,start
    set nostartofline
    set ruler
    set laststatus=2
    set mouse=a
    set cmdheight=2
    set shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4  " tab column size
    command DiffOrig vert new | set bt=nofile | r # | 0d_ | diffthis
        \ | wincmd p | diffthis
    " Press Space to turn off search highlighting and clear any message.
    :nnoremap <silent> <Space> :nohlsearch<Bar>:echo<CR>
    " Silent.
    set visualbell t_vb=
    " Allow switching from an unsaved buffer without saving it first.
    set hidden
    if has('gui_running')
      set guioptions-=T  " no toolbar
      colorscheme elflord  " choose your own
    endif
<

See disable beeping [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Disable_beeping] for 
information on the 'visualbell' option, and see example vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Example_vimrc] for further ideas.

As an example of a configuration file, create file python.vim in the 
directory $HOME\vimfiles\after\ftplugin (you will need to create the vimfiles 
and after and ftplugin directories). The file should contain:

>
    setlocal expandtab
<

After creating the directories, you can enter this command in Vim to create 
the file (~ is the same as $HOME):

>
    :e ~\vimfiles\after\ftplugin\python.vim
<

The effect of this example is that, when editing *.py files, the 'expandtab' 
option will be set, so spaces will be inserted when the Tab key is pressed.

INSTALLING VIM  *vwt-1673-installing-vim*

After building, copy the executables and runtime files to overwrite the 
current Vim installation (or to create it). This can be run from any 
directory. Any previous runtime files are overwritten. Make sure Vim is not 
running.

>
    \myname\bin\vimcopy.cmd
<

This uses file vimcopy.cmd (created in an earlier step) to copy the Vim files 
from the build directory to directory C:\myname\bin\vim\vim73 (and 
subdirectories).

Vim can now be run in a command prompt window, although it is necessary to 
adjust the PATH:

>
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\myname\bin\vim\vim73
    gvim
<

To permanently update the PATH, run System Properties: on the Advanced tab, 
click Environment Variables. An administrator can edit "Path" under System 
variables (which will apply to all users). Append ;C:\myname\bin\vim\vim73 to 
the existing PATH.

If other tools are placed in the bin directory, also append ;C:\myname\bin to 
the PATH. If that is done, the "build" step can use vimconfig rather than 
\myname\bin\vimconfig.cmd, and the "installing" step can use vimcopy rather 
than \myname\bin\vimcopy.cmd

It is possible to add an "Edit with Vim" entry to the Windows Explorer 
context menu. If that is not wanted, installation is finished, and gvim can be 
run from a command prompt window. It is also possible to drag and drop one or 
more files from Windows Explorer to gvim and then to display each file in its 
own tab by entering :tab sball.

To add an "Edit with Vim" entry to the context menu, as an administrator open 
a command prompt window and enter:

>
    cd \myname\bin\vim\vim73
    install
<

The install.exe program runs in a command prompt window and presents a series 
of options regarding the actions that it will take. Actions can be configured 
or disabled by responding to the prompts. One of the possible actions is to 
generate a sample vimrc file which is not recommended. The option to add an 
entry to the popup (context) menu only works when performed by an 
administrator.

DIFF PROGRAM  *vwt-1673-diff-program*

Vim can display the differences between files, providing a diff program is 
available. Windows users should download the setup program for "Complete 
package, except sources" from GnuWin32 diff 
[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm]. Run setup and either 
accept the defaults, or install in a temporary directory that you will later 
delete (perhaps by running the uninstall program). If wanted, you can install 
without administrative privileges: select "Don't create a Start Menu folder" 
and click Ignore several times when setup fails to write to the registry. Copy 
files diff.exe and *.dll from the resulting GnuWin32\bin subdirectory to a 
directory that is in your PATH (you could use C:\myname\bin\vim\vim73 although 
it would be better to use another directory for programs not distributed with 
Vim).

If you have run the Vim install.exe program and used it to generate a sample 
vimrc file, it will include set diffexpr=MyDiff() which is not wanted: remove 
that line (and the MyDiff function) from vimrc.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1673-comments*

TO DO
    - Show a HUGE or BIG build example to show how it's done. 
    - Check claims made about MyDiff and if valid, explain why it isn't wanted. 
      Fritzophrenic has to use MyDiff to make diffs. Check when used with paths with 
      embedded spaces.

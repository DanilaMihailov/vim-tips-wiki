I was trying kde's knetattach yesterday. It doesn't seem to know about Vim's 
built-in remote editing commands. To get knetattach to play nicely with Vim, I 
wrote the following Python script and made it the default application for 
remote text files. The application command line reads "net_vim_open.py %u", 
where %u is translated to the remote fish url.

>
    #!/usr/bin/python
    #net_vim_open.py
    
    import os, sys
    
    def open_gvim():
      v = sys.argv[1];
      if v[0:4] != 'fish':
        error_file = open('.net_vim_errors','a');
        print >> error_file, "Error starting gvim";
        print >> error_file, sys.argv;
        error_file.close();
      else:
        v = v.replace("fish:", "scp:", 1);
        v = v.replace(":22", "/", 1);
        cmd = ' '.join(['gvim',v]);
        os.system(cmd);
      return;
    
    open_gvim();
    sys.exit();

==============================================================================

Have you ever been annoyed with that fact that :new opens a buffer above the 
current window instead of below? If yes, then try :below new to open the new 
window below the current one, for this one command.

You can also have all splits open below the current window by default, using 
the option. For example, place the following in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    set splitbelow
<

The process is similar if you want vertically-split windows to open to the 
right. Use :below vnew to create a new vertical buffer on the right, or put 
the following in vimrc:

>
    set splitright
<

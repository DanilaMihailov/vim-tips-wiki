==============================================================================

Someone once posted a patch to add a new event called GetChar to receive an 
event for every keypress. This trick is not as powerful and flexible as that, 
but it can be very useful for a plugin, and is supported in Vim 7.0 with no 
patches.

Often there are questions on how to capture every key press from a user. The 
answer is that you can't, unless you map all keys. But even if you map all 
keys, it is not flexible enough. Here is a trick with recursive <expr> maps 
and getchar() to have all keys pass through your function. You can do whatever 
you want with the keys, swallow them or pass them to Vim.

Here is a demo that shows how to use it in insert mode. What the function 
does is to double every key you press, except <Esc> and <C-C>, when it breaks 
the loop.

>
    imap <buffer> <silent> <expr> <F12> Double("\<F12>")
    function! Double(mymap)
      try
        let char = getchar()
      catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
        let char = "\<Esc>"
      endtry
      "exec BPBreakIf(char == 32, 1)
      if char == '^\d\+$' || type(char) == 0
        let char = nr2char(char)
      endif " It is the ascii code.
      if char == "\<Esc>"
        return ''
      endif
      redraw
      return char.char."\<C-R>=Redraw()\<CR>".a:mymap
    endfunction
    
    function! Redraw()
      redraw
      return ''
    endfunction
<

You can do almost anything that you can do normally in an insert mode, press 
<BS>, <C-U> etc.

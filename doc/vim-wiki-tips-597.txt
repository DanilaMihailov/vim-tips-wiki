==============================================================================

This tip contains information about adjusting the indent of source code in a 
block formed by braces ({...}), such as is used in the C language.

COMMANDS TO INDENT BLOCKS  *vwt-597-commands-to-indent-blocks*

Suppose the indent options are correctly defined and we find this badly 
indented code:

>
    int myfunction(int a)
     {
     if ( a == 1 ) {
     printf("one");
    return 1;        // the cursor is in this line
     }
     return 0;
       }
<

These commands will fix the indents:
    - =i{ reindents "inner block" (inside the braces).
    - =a{ reindents "a block" (including the braces).
    - =2a{ reindents 2 blocks (this block and containing block).


Instead of "{", you can use "}" or "B", for example, =aB indents a block.

These commands will decrease or increase indents:
    - >i{ increase indent for inner block.
    - . repeat last change (increase indent of block again).
    - <i{ decrease indent for inner block.


With the cursor on { or }:
    - =% indents the block (including matching brace).
    - >% or <% indents or unindents the block.

==============================================================================

If the power fails, or your computer crashes, any file you were editing 
probably won't be saved. However, when the computer is restarted, you should 
be able to recover the file by typing:

>
    vim -r <filename>
<

where <filename> is the name of the file you were editing at the time of the 
crash.

If you were editing without a file name, enter:

>
    vim -r ""
<

You can list the recoverable files:

>
    vim -r
<

Each of these commands should be executed in the directory where you were 
when the crash occurred.

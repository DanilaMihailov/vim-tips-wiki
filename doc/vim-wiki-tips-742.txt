I recently installed pyblosxom to do blogging, using Vim to edit blog posts. 
Pyblosxom automatically transforms .txt files under a certain path into HTML, 
RSS, or whatever else is appropriate. These .txt files will probably contain 
HTML, so if you would like to tell Vim to use a different syntax highlighting 
style for files under a directory path, try adding this to your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile ~/.pyblosxom/data/* set syntax=html
<

As an aside, another way to go about this would be a user command that gives 
you a skeleton entry, saved and named (for instance current time/date stamp) 
as you desire with your cursor placed where you want. File format, patch mode 
and other such options can be set as desired as well.

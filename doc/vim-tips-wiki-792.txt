==============================================================================

There never seem to be enough spare keys for maps.

It's possible however to preload Vim's registers in vimrc with your frequent 
commands, for example:

>
    let @m=":'a,'bs/"
    let @s=":%!sort -u"
<

Here's a twisted one

>
    let @y='yy@"'
<

The command is executed by doing a `@m`

You can overwrite them of course when doing a recording or a plain yank; I 
prefer to leave registers a-q for yanks or recordings and preload the others.

Why not use prefix and/or virtual keys like gnu-emacs? Then refer to it by 
the virtual name.

Also I think Gvim supports 5 Xmodifiers as in gnu-emacs, (C-M-S-H-s-A-<key>) 
= (2^6 * 40) 2500 should be enough?

All your mappings go into ,<key> (personally I like named keys) and in emacs, 
I can invoke by name with completions, if I forget the mapping.

==============================================================================

I already have 96 maps many with two character combinations using , and 
<Leader>.Preloading registers is just a possible alternative, and maybe avoids 
some of the syntaxical restrictions of maps,as they contain command sequences 
just as you would type them ie a recording'.

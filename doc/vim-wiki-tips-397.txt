I personally find it very awkward and unintuitive to browse the documentation 
using Ctrl-] for following the link and Ctrl-Shift-t to go back. I have had an 
idea to to remap those commands to Enter and Backspace, since I do not use 
those keys in help in normal mode.

The command :nnoremap <buffer> can remap the key only in the given buffer 
without affecting the other buffers.

Just create file $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/help.vim with following contens:

>
    " Only do this when not done yet for this buffer
    if exists("b:did_ftplugin")
      finish
    endif
    
    " map ctrl-] to enter in normal mode only for this buffer
    nnoremap <buffer><CR> <c-]>
    
    " map ctrl-T to backspace in normal mode only for this buffer
    nnoremap <buffer><BS> <c-T>

You can adapt this to also use it with the man page file type, so you can hit 
return on a ref to another man page etc.

I had to use the after config file "~/.vim/after/ftplugin/man.vim" and nmap 
instead of nnoremap to getting it working. (I think this is because the 
default man.vim needs to set its remap of <c-]> first.)

==============================================================================

Very useful mappings for helpfiles. I've added them to my help.vim, which 
also contains these for navigating from |label| to |label|:

>
    nnoremap <buffer> <Tab> /<Bar>\k*<Bar><CR>
    nnoremap <buffer> <S-Tab> ?<Bar>\k*<Bar><CR>
    " Can't get s-tab to work in xterm, so...
    nmap <buffer> . <Tab>
    nmap <buffer> , <S-Tab>
<

==============================================================================

I couldn't get it working by using the help.vim file. Adding these lines to 
.vimrc seems to work though:

>
    :au filetype help :nnoremap <buffer><CR> <c-]>
    :au filetype help :nnoremap <buffer><BS> <c-T>
<

==============================================================================

To avoid display of '|' when using goulding(princeton.edu) mappings above, 
use theese instead:

>
    nnoremap <buffer> <Tab> /<Bar>\zs\k*\ze<Bar><CR>
    nnoremap <buffer> <S-Tab> ?<Bar>\zs\k*\ze<Bar><CR>
<

Also, don't put your mappings in $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/help.vim but instead in 
$HOME/{.vim|vimfiles}/after/ftplugin/help.vim (without the didftplugin check), 
as this will not completely override any ftplugin settings set by the Vim 
distribution either in this version or a next upgrade.

==============================================================================

Here is my ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/help.vim and ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/man.vim 
(same content):

>
    " Browse just with <CR>/<BS>
    " We allow remapping of <C-]> as ftplugin/man.vim remaps it
    nmap <buffer><CR> <C-]>
    nnoremap <buffer><BS> <C-T>
    if &filetype == 'help'
      " Lookup |label| using <Tab>/<S-Tab>
      nnoremap <buffer> <Tab> /<Bar>\zs\k*\ze<Bar><CR>
      nnoremap <buffer> <S-Tab> ?<Bar>\zs\k*\ze<Bar><CR>
    endif

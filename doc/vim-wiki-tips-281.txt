==============================================================================

When scrolling or searching through a large file, it can be convenient to 
keep the cursor line near the middle of the screen (vertically centered within 
the window). This tip introduces the scrolloff option, and shows another 
possible technique using the zz command.

SCROLLOFF OPTION  *vwt-281-scrolloff-option*

The 'scrolloff' (scroll offset) option determines the number of context lines 
you would like to see above and below the cursor. The following command 
scrolls the text so that (when possible) there are always at least five lines 
visible above the cursor, and five lines visible below the cursor:

>
    :set scrolloff=5
<

The above command can be abbreviated as :set so=5. Entering :set so=0 
restores the default behavior so the cursor can be moved to any line in the 
window without scrolling.

CENTERING WITH SCROLLOFF  *vwt-281-centering-with-scrolloff*

Setting 'scrolloff' to a large value causes the cursor to stay in the middle 
line when possible:

>
    :set so=999
<

To restore normal behavior, enter:

>
    :set so=0
<

If you change 'scrolloff' frequently, you may want to use a mapping. With the 
following in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], and assuming the 
default backslash leader key, you can type \zz to toggle the value of 
'scrolloff' between 0 and 999:

>
    :nnoremap <Leader>zz :let &scrolloff=999-&scrolloff<CR>
<

In an expression, &scrolloff refers to the value of the 'scrolloff' option. 
The :let command assigns a value to 'scrolloff'; that value is 999-0 if 
'scrolloff' was 0, and is 999-999 if 'scrolloff' was 999.

CENTERING AUTOMATICALLY WITH AUTOCMDS  *vwt-281-centering-automatically-with-autocmds*

Setting scrolloff to 999 can have undesired consequences, however. 
Forexample, a script that processes text at the end of your file cancause 
those last lines (and your cursor, if it’s on them) to disappear from viewat 
the bottom of the page. Avoid this by using autocmds.

If you almost always prefer to have your cursor centered vertically on the 
screen, add this to your vimrc:

>
    augroup VCenterCursor
      au!
      au BufEnter,WinEnter,WinNew,VimResized *,*.*
            \ let &scrolloff=winheight(win_getid())/2
    augroup END
<

This will keep your cursor centered when you start up, move to another 
window, add or remove windows or tabs, or resize the GUI. You can disable it 
during your session with

>
    au! VCenterCursor
<

win_getid() returns the ID number of the active window, and 
winheight(win_getid()) returns the active window’s height in lines visible 
above its status line, if it has one. Dividing the window’s height by 2 gives 
the number of visual lines on either side of the center line if the height is 
odd, the greater by 1 if even.

If you prefer to toggle scrolloff with the <leader>zz mapping as suggested 
above (“<leader>” is the backslash character “\” by default), add this to your 
vimrc:

>
    set scrolloff=<any startup value you like>
    if !exists('*VCenterCursor')
      augroup VCenterCursor
      au!
      au OptionSet *,*.*
        \ if and( expand("<amatch>")=='scrolloff' ,
        \         exists('#VCenterCursor#WinEnter,WinNew,VimResized') )|
        \   au! VCenterCursor WinEnter,WinNew,VimResized|
        \ endif
      augroup END
      function VCenterCursor()
        if !exists('#VCenterCursor#WinEnter,WinNew,VimResized')
          let s:default_scrolloff=&scrolloff
          let &scrolloff=winheight(win_getid())/2
          au VCenterCursor WinEnter,WinNew,VimResized *,*.*
            \ let &scrolloff=winheight(win_getid())/2
        else
          au! VCenterCursor WinEnter,WinNew,VimResized
          let &scrolloff=s:default_scrolloff
        endif
      endfunction
    endif
    
    nnoremap <leader>zz :call VCenterCursor()<CR>
<

The function VCenterCursor() toggles between automatically centering 
yourcursor and setting scrolloff to the last value that you manually set. If 
youmanually set a new scrolloff value, the OptionSet autocmd detects this and 
stops the other autocmds from setting scrolloff until you call the function 
againwith <leader>zz.

Currently it is not possible to set scrolloff locally (tested on MSWindows 7 
with GVIM 64-bit, version 8.0.271). Furthermore, autocmddetection fails when 
you resize the active window without resizing the GUI;leave and reenter that 
window or do <leader>zz twice to get the right value.

MAPPING WANTED KEYS  *vwt-281-mapping-wanted-keys*

An alternative to setting 'scrolloff' would be to remap some commands so that 
they vertically center the cursor, for example, when moving down or up with j 
and k. Remap the commands like this:

>
    :nnoremap j jzz
    :nnoremap k kzz
<

==============================================================================

Problem: When you modify a file and write contents to a different file, Vim 
resets the 'modified' flag, which is a Vi compatible behavior. For those who 
don't want the 'modified' flag reset, the suggested alternative is to use 
`:saveas` command instead of `:write` command, but this changes the name of 
the current buffer rather than what is wanted. So I have cooked up the 
following solution which seems to work for regular files, but it is not a fool 
proof mechanism. The problem is plugins like netrw that catch the event that 
is triggered when you try to write contents to a different file, and the below 
solution also uses the same mechanism, so it would end up getting triggered 
unexpectedly (actually, netrw might work just fine, but you would get ugly 
error messages in addition).

I have provided a simple workaround for taking care of at least netrw. 
Basically, it checks if netrw would react to the event and if so skip itself. 
A more sophisticated solution would actually parse the output of ":au 
BufWriteCmd" and automatically check if there are other event handlers for 
this file, but there are not all that many plugins that take advantage of this 
event (actually I am aware of only netrw), so the workaround should be 
sufficient (actually, I haven't tested the netrw filenames, so I am not sure 
it would work). What you should do is to run the ":au BufWriteCmd" before 
installing this solution and see what other autocommands exist, other than 
those that are for netrw. You will have to then tweek the code that returns 
early from the BufWrite() function.

Put the below code in your vimrc and your `:write` will work as expected 
(i.e. as described above).

>
    function! SetBufWriteAuEnabled(enabled)
      aug BufWrite
        au!
        if a:enabled
          au BufWriteCmd * :call BufWrite()
        endif
      aug END
    endfunction
    call SetBufWriteAuEnabled(1)
    
    function! BufWrite()
      let fileName = expand('<afile>')
      " If the filename already matches netrw's criteria, then don't do anything.
      if fileName =~ 'ftp://\|rcp://\|scp://\|dav://\|rync://\|sftp://'
        return
      endif
      let _modified = &modified
      exec 'w'.(v:cmdbang?'!':'') v:cmdarg fileName
      " This autocommand gets triggered by Vim even if the writing is happening to
      " the same file, so we don't want to modify the behavior of bare :w or :wq
      " commands.
      if expand('%') !=# fileName
        " This *is* the actual work around. Restore the 'modified' flag.
        let &modified = _modified
      endif
    endfunction

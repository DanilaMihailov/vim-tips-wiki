This tip applies only to non-GUI Vim running in xterm under X11/XWindows 
(linux, unix or cygwin).

When you want to use Vim's 'clientserver' features, you have this problem 
with non-GUI Vim under xterm: In Vim under xterm, 'servername' is disabled by 
default even when 'clientserver' feature is compiled into Vim.

This is different from GUI gvim, where 'servername' is enabled by default.

1. If you want to enable 'servername' for vim/xterm, the first thing to check 
is whether vim has 'clientserver' feature compiled-in: do ':version' and check 
for +clientserver; or do

'vim -h| grep servername'
in shell. If 'clientserver' is compiled in, proceed to the next step.
If 'clientserver' is not compiled in, you have several choices:
symlink vim to gvim (if you have gvim installed).
install vim with 'clientserver' support from binaries
build vim from sources with clientserver support and install it

2. After you checked that vim has 'clientserver' compiled in, there are 
several methods to enable 'servername' for vim/xterm. Methods are listed 
below:

Method (A) If you the want simplest solution, just define shell aliases:

For csh/tcsh: alias vim 'vim --servername vim'
For bash/ksh: alias vim='vim --servername vim'

The drawback of this method is that vim will not have servername enabled when started from a script.

Method (B) When you're non-root user and vim is installed system-wide by sysadmin:

create directory $HOME/myvim: `mkdir $HOME/myvim`
add directory $HOME/myvim to your $PATH, but make sure it appears in the PATH the first, before all other directories, or at least before the directory where vim is installed (command 'which vim' tells you where)
do 'which vim'. Remember directory where system-wide vim is installed. You'll use name of this directory in the next step, in the 2nd line of the script.
create script called 'vim' in directory $HOME/myvim, with these 2 lines:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/vim --servername vim "$@"
NB: you *must* use full pathname in the 2nd line of the script

chmod a+x $HOME/myvim/vim
if your shell is tcsh/csh, do 'unhash'


Method (C) When you are root user and you want to enable 'server' for all users; or when you are non-root user and you installed vim yourself under your $HOME:

find out where vim is installed: % which vim
cd to the directory where vim is installed
remember name of this directory, you'll use in the nest step in the 2nd line of the script:
in same directory, create script called 'vim.s' with this contents:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/vim.bin --servername vim "$@"
NB: you *must* use full pathname in the 2nd line of the script

chmod a+x vim.s
mv vim vim.bin
mv vim.s vim

The drawback of this method is that when you reinstall Vim, you need to repeat the renaming.

COMMENTS  *vwt-699-comments*

This tip contains some decent information on how to set up alias for using 
the Vim server, and a decent introduction on needing the +clientserver 
feature. It also contains some really bad advice about renaming the vim 
binary. It can probably be shortened to a couple of paragraphs, and should 
probably be merged with other tips. (Spiiph

==============================================================================

Of course, if you only want to run Vim as server, you can then invoke it 
(when desired) as

>
    vim --servername whatever
<

replacing "whatever" by the desired server name.

To check whether a server is already running, use

>
    vim --serverlist
<

If there is no answer (with exit status zero), it means there is no available 
server; and if your Vim hasn't got +clientserver compiled-in, you'll get an 
error message and a nonzero exit status.

For Ubuntu to install +clientserver you need to install vim-gnome, example:

>
    apt-get install vim-gnome
<



==============================================================================

Personnaly I just put the following function in my .zshrc file (but also take 
a look at the editexisting.vim plugin):

>
    # Function for always using one (and only one) vim server, even when not
    # using gvim.
    # If you really want a new vim session, simply do not pass any
    # argument to this function.
    function vim {
      vim_orig=$(which 2>/dev/null vim)
      if [ -z $vim_orig ]; then
        echo "$SHELL: vim: command not found"
        return 127;
      fi
      $vim_orig --serverlist | grep -q VIM
      # If there is already a vimserver, use it
      # unless no args were given
      if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
          $vim_orig
        else
          $vim_orig --remote "$@"
        fi
      else
        $vim_orig --servername vim "$@"
      fi
    }

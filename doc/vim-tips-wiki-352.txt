Have you ever been annoyed by an over-zealous cabbrev? A simple way to 
temporarily disable it is `set invpaste`. Very convenient in combination with 
the 'pastetoggle' key. Note however that 'pastetoggle' does not work if you 
are already in command-line mode, as documented in the help.

You can also simply press <C-V> before whatever character (usually <space>) 
that you type that will expand the abbreviation. This will insert the 
character literally without expanding the abbreviation.

Does anybody have a better way to disable cabbrev's? The Vim docs (a little 
above help abbreviate-local) say pressing <C-v> twice somewhere within the 
abbrev avoids expanding it. Doesn't work for me, though. Pressing <C-v><Space> 
works in the ':' prompt, but not while searching - what if I don't want to 
include a space in the pattern?

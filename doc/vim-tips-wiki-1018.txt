==============================================================================

I use tags a lot. I usually have one tag file per subsystem and I add and 
remove them from my tags variable when my "focus" changes.

Anyway, one circumstance that I find myself in some times is that I know a 
function exists and I have a good idea what it's called but can't remember the 
exact name.

Scenario: find the event handler function.

Ambiguity: Is it handleEvent, HandleEvent, handle_the_event?

Solution: Use regular expressions and command completion to guess.

    :tj /handle.*event<C-D>

When using the tag family of commands you can search through tags when the 
first character of the keyword you give to the command is /

When used in conjunction with command-line completion (using CTRL-D) you get 
"instant" feedback on whether your regular expression was close enough.

In a simpler scenario all tag searches using the / character are case 
insensitive, so even when used without a regular expression, / can help you 
find the tag you're looking for.

I should point out that if you have ignorecase (ic) set, then the tags family 
of commands all do tag lookup in a case insensitive manner, so using / without 
a regular expression is really just a one-off short-cut to dong a tags lookup 
whilst ignoring case. It really just saves you setting ic and then unsetting 
it afterwards.

==============================================================================

Or you can use /\cregexp for searching (adding \c after / makes the search 
case insensitive).

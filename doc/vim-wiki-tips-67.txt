==============================================================================

You can learn the ASCII or Unicode value of the character under the cursor by 
pressing ga in command mode or :as / :ascii on the command line . This 
displays the value of the current character in decimal, hex and octal. (Think 
"get ascii.")

SEEING ASCII/UNICODE VALUES IN THE STATUS LINE  *vwt-67-seeing-ascii/unicode-values-in-the-status-line*

You can also add options to the statusline option to show theASCII/Unicode 
value of the character under the cursor.

>
    :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
<

It's the %b\ 0x%B that does the trick. Note that you may need to :set 
laststatus=2 so that the status line is visible in edit sessions with only one 
window showing.

RELATED SCRIPTS  *vwt-67-related-scripts*
    -  The characterize plugin [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4410] overrides the ga command to provide even more useful information for Unicode characters, such as any  |digraphs| Vim has defined to enter the character.
    -  The unicode plugin [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2822] also provides additional information for any character without overriding the ga normal command. It provides the :UnicodeName command, that displays the official Unicode name for any character as well as defined digraphs or html entity name. This also works correctly for combined chars.

% KEY                                                            *vwt-6-%-key*

The % key can be used for the following :
    - To jump to a matching opening or closing parenthesis, square bracket or a 
      curly brace: ([{}]) 
    - To jump to start or end of a C-style comment: /* */. 
    - To jump to a matching C/C++ preprocessor conditional: #if, #ifdef, #else, 
      #elif, #endif. 
    - To jump between appropriate keywords, if supported by the ftplugin file, for 
      example, between begin and end in a Pascal program. 


A nice keymap is:

>
    noremap % v%
<

This way, whenever you type % you jump to the matching object, and you 
visually select all the text in between. It's useful for indenting a C/C++ 
method/class: go to opening/closing brace, and type =%

SHOWMATCH                                                    *vwt-6-showmatch*

The showmatch option is also useful: it can reduce the need for %, the cursor 
will briefly jump to the matching brace when you insert one.

To speed things up, you can set the 'matchtime' option. In vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    :set showmatch
    :set matchtime=3
<

The 'showmatch' option will not scroll the screen. To scroll the screen you 
can use a mapping like:

>
    inoremap } }<Left><c-o>%<c-o>:sleep 500m<CR><c-o>%<c-o>a
    inoremap ] ]<Left><c-o>%<c-o>:sleep 500m<CR><c-o>%<c-o>a
    inoremap ) )<Left><c-o>%<c-o>:sleep 500m<CR><c-o>%<c-o>a
<

MATCHIT                                                        *vwt-6-matchit*

The matchit.vim script allows you to configure % to match more than just 
single characters. You can match words and even regular expressions. Also, 
matching treats strings and comments (as recognized by the syntax highlighting 
mechanism) intelligently.

Matchit is included in the Vim standard distribution since version 6, but 
it's not enabled by default.

The version at Vim scripts 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39] is usually more up to 
date, so you probably want that one. Unzip it in your ~/.vim directory.To use 
the version included with Vim copy $VIMRUNTIME/macros/matchit.vim to 
~/.vim/plugin and $VIMRUNTIME/macros/matchit.txt to ~/.vim/doc.

Rebuild the help tags with :helptags ~/.vim/doc

For example, you can now use % and g% to cycle back and forth between if and 
fi in shell scripts.

See :help |matchit-install| for more information on installing matchit. After 
installation you can use :help matchit for usage information.

COMMENTS                                                      *vwt-6-comments*

You can select a block delimited by braces using any the following:
    - With the cursor on a brace, type v% to select to the matching brace. 
    - With the cursor inside a block, type viB (inner block) or vaB (a block, 
      including the braces). 
    - Using a mouse, double-click a brace.

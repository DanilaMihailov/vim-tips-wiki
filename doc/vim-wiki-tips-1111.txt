==============================================================================

To avoid the extra 'shift' keypress when typing the colon to go to cmdline 
mode, I mapped the semicolon key to do the same thing.

>
    :nmap ; :
<

This overwrites the original mapping of repeating the last f or t command.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1111-comments*

You can do the following to regain the functionality of ;

>
    nnoremap ; :
    nnoremap : ;
    vnoremap ; :
    vnoremap : ;
<

==============================================================================

I use the following instead:

>
    map ; :
<

This takes over the ; even in visual mode (why should I be forced to hold the 
shift down there but not in normal mode?). Furthermore, sometimes I want to 
run a custom command that starts with a capital letter, so I might have the 
shift already held down when I hit the ; (making it a colon), which would 
cause problems if the colon were mapped back to the semicolon. I get around 
this by this mapping:

>
    noremap ;; ;
<

So, to get the original ; behaviour, I just hit it twice.

As a rule, I don't get encumbered by the timeout delay caused by the 
ambiguous mapping because I hit another character immediately after ; when 
it's a command I'm trying to execute from the command-line. The delay is only 
a problem if I hit the ; and hit nothing else after it. If I hit ;s, for 
example (the start of :sp), there is no delay.

CAVEATS  *vwt-1111-caveats*

When you run a command like :ls that leaves output on the screen while 
waiting for you to enter another command, using semi-colon instead of colon 
will cause the output of :ls to be hidden as soon as you start entering the 
new command. There may be a fix for this, but I haven't found one yet.

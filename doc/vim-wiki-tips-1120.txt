==============================================================================

Did you ever notice how syntax highlight of the whole screen below current 
line changes when you start a string line (at least, in .py Python files)? Vim 
thinks the rest of the screen is inside a string and highlights it as such. I 
find this extremely annoying and I found a very neat fix: you have to edit the 
syntax file for Python (or some other language), and add 'oneline' to the 
relevant line:

>
    syn region pythonString matchgroup=Normal start=+[uU]\='+ end=+'+ skip=+\\\\\|\'+ contains=pythonEscape oneline
    syn region pythonString matchgroup=Normal start=+[uU]\="+ end=+"+ skip=+\\\\\|\\"+ contains=pythonEscape oneline
<

This way, only the current line will change, from cursor to the end of line. 
Usually you're entering the string at the end of line, so you'll have no 
changes in syntax at all.

But then you lose the ability to see when you've forgotten to close a quote, 
etc.

==============================================================================

Just map the sting delimiter key to produce a pair of them and position you 
between them.

>
    inoremap " ""<Esc>i
<

That way you do not forget to close the string and you do not have the syntax 
coloring problem.

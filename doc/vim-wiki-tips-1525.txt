==============================================================================

If you use Vim to write LaTeX documents, you probably have been frustrated by 
the fact that the gqap command doesn't respect equations and other 
environments. It takes something like

    I have discovered a marvelous proof of the following equation which this
    blog post is too narrow to contain:
    \begin{displaymath}
      a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    \end{displaymath}
    where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of an equilateral triangle.

and turns it into

The following mappings help the gq command understand what delimits 
paragraphs in LaTeX source files:

>
    map \gq ?^$\\|^\s*\(\\begin\\|\\end\\|\\label\)?1<CR>gq//-1<CR>
    omap lp ?^$\\|^\s*\(\\begin\\|\\end\\|\\label\)?1<CR>//-1<CR>.<CR>
<

With these, you can use \gq or gqlp ("gq LaTeX paragraph") to format 
paragraphs in your LaTeX files. Lines that begin with some whitespace, then a 
backslash, then "begin", "end", or "label" (along with blank lines) are 
considered to delimit paragraphs and won't be changed, just the text between 
them.

Perhaps a better solution would be to change the 'paragraphs' option (:help 
'paragraphs') so that one could specify a regexp that delimits paragraphs, 
instead of just listing some nroff macros!

Don't you mean right triangle?

==============================================================================

When editing multiple files, it is often necessary to switch from one file to 
another. That can be done more easily using a mapping, rather than entering a 
command. This tip maps Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab to move forwards or 
backwards through the available buffers or windows.

If you prefer to work with buffers, you can map the `:bn` and `:bp` commands 
(buffer next, and buffer previous).

>
    nnoremap <C-Tab> :bn<CR>
    nnoremap <C-S-Tab> :bp<CR>
<

If you frequently use split windows, you might want to use the Ctrl-W family 
of commands to switch between windows.

>
    nnoremap <C-Tab> <C-w>w
    nnoremap <C-S-Tab> <C-w>W
<

And if you prefer one tab for one buffer, you can map the `:tabn` and `:tabp` 
commands (tab next, and tab previous).

>
    nnoremap <C-Tab> :tabn<CR>
    nnoremap <C-S-Tab> :tabp<CR>

      <Tab>.

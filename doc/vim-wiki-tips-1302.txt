This was inspired by VimTip173 |vwt-173|. Sometimes you don't want to have 
your windows on their max or min width (length) so I added the following 
commands to my vimrc.

>
    "This two change in between vertical windows maximizing their length, and if you keep them pressed they will increase width by 2 columns steps.
    "very nice when lines are too long to fit in just one row.
    nmap <c-h> <c-w>h<c-w>_<c-w>><c-w>>
    nmap <c-l> <c-w>l<c-w>_<c-w>><c-w>>
<

The same can be done for the horizontal split.

TO DO Take the time to figure out how to make this useful. By length the 
author means height. Should use a repeat number. If you need this tip to 
increase the width, won't you need a way to decrease it?

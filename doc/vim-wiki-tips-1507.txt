==============================================================================

Bad luck happens.

On the Vim mailing list, one user complained about irrepairable file 
corruption that happened after OS crash and reboot. The filesystem repair 
utility, fsck, dutily repaired the filesystem at the expense of losing large 
pieces of data from his file. Yick. Recently changed files suffer most danger 
if OS crashes.

The following autocommand will decrease chances of file loss in case of 
unexpected hardware failure or unexpected electricity failure:

>
    " disk sync after every write
    au BufWritePost * silent !sync
<

May uninterrupted power be with you.

    - Be careful, this can freeze your vim session on heavy disk io, e.g. writing 
      to a slow usb flash. 
    - Setting option 'swapsync' might be an alternative to the mentioned 
      autocommand. 


==============================================================================

Well, bad luck happens, but irrepairable filesystem corruption is extremely 
rare on journalising filesystems. I use reiserfs, because that was the only 
one which was available and "stably" supported when I installed a new drive 
some years ago; but on recent Linux kernels ext3 and (even better, I've been 
told) ext4 filesystems are recommended, with the advantage that you can 
convert an ext2 filesystem to them in-place. An other, very old, trick 
consists in saving your data to disk at intervals of between five minutes and 
a quarter-hour, and also every time you leave the keyboard, even if it's just 
to take a leak. — Tonymec [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:Tonymec] 16:14,

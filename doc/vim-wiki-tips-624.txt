==============================================================================

While editing HTML I want to use template files to be expanded on my html 
pages. Say for example I have something like this on my html file:

>
    #refile=path/templates/header.html
    <p>html code here</p>
    <p>more html code here...</p>
    #refile=path/templates/footer.html
<

I want the files header.html and footer.html to be inserted on my page, you 
can do this with the following command:

>
    command! -range=% Refile <line1>,<line2>g/^#refile=/exe ":r " . strpart(getline("."), 8) | normal! kdd
     " 'Read_vim' / Revise by reading in file templates.
     " Get the string part after the = sign, on line(s) which
     " *begin* with #revim= , and use that to read in said file
     " -------------------- (kdd deletes the # line; put comments in templates).

NOTES  *vwt-624-notes*
    - The filenames are not embedded in comments because they could be easily overlooked later.
    - refile stands for reference file

==============================================================================

What to do if Vim's menu bar disappears due to a bug in GNOME 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME], so that gvim cannot display its menu?

CHANGING GUIOPTIONS                             *vtw-1677-changing-guioptions*

The standard method for displaying or hiding the menu bar is to use these 
commands in gvim:
    - `:set guioptions+=m` enable (display) menu bar 
    - `:set guioptions-=m` disable (hide) menu bar 


If you are using Gnome/Metacity, a problem may prevent the menu bar from 
being displayed: Gnome tries to dock the menu in a place where you cannot see 
it. A test to see if this is the issue is to open gvim as root (with `sudo 
gvim`), then see if the menu can be enabled and disabled using the above 
commands.

SOLUTION                                                   *vtw-1677-solution*

Open a terminal and enter the command:

>
    rm ~/.gnome2/Vim
<

and/or:

>
    rm ~/.gnome/Vim
<

That is, delete the file under your home directory where Gnome keeps its 
settings for Vim. It will be recreated when you run gvim again. With luck, the 
menu will be displayed again.

Deleting the file `~/.gnome2/Vim` worked, but the problem recurs. Examining 
this file shows that the problem is that the toolbar and the menubar are 
overlayed:

>
    [Placement]
    Dock=Toolbar\\0,0,0,0\\Menubar\\0,0,0,0
<

Change this to:

>
    [Placement]
    Dock=Toolbar\\0,1,0,0\\Menubar\\0,0,0,0
<

This solves the problem. The question however remains, namely how does this 
file get repeatedly corrupted in the first place. --December 29, 2011.

This works on Ubuntu 14.04, June 2014. --July 5, 2014

==============================================================================

If deleting `~/.gnome2/Vim` does not work, check the `.vimrc` file permission 
to make sure the current user can read it. If GVim is installed by root, or 
the .vimrc file is copied from a flash key, its permission may prevent other 
users from reading it when starting GVim. When that happens all custom 
settings in .vimrc, including the menu, do not apply, causing the menu not to 
be shown. --Oct 2013

==============================================================================

On Ubuntu Xenial, using the vim-gtk3 package rather than vim-gnome solves the 
problem. This is due to a recent version of compiz causing issues with unity

ON UBUNTU                                                 *vtw-1677-on-ubuntu*
    - If you are using Unity and want GVim's menu bar attached to the window, start 
      GVim with the terminal command: 


>
    $ UBUNTU_MENUPROXY="" gvim
<

The variable is usually set to "libappmenu.so" (in /usr/lib/indicators3/7/). 
Clearing it launch GVim without using Unity global menus. -- Jan 2014

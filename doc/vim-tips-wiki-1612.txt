==============================================================================

It may be helpful to run a commmand periodically in the background. This can 
be used, for example, to write an auto-updating clock in Vim, or to check for 
user input via an input loop, such as in a game. In one application, Vim was 
used as a front end for a media player, where the song information had to be 
updated and other actions taken when a song finished.

FAKING A TIMER                                       *vtw-1612-faking-a-timer*

Since there is no timer function in Vim < version 8, a trick is needed: the 
CursorHold autocommand that re-triggers itself. In the following, feedkeys() 
function is used with specially crafted key sequence that has no effect except 
re-triggering the autoevent. The period depends on the value of `updatetime` 
option (also known as `ut`). The value of `updatetime` option is in 
milliseconds. Do not set the value too low.

    autocmd CursorHold * call Timer()
    function! Timer()
      call feedkeys("f\e")
      " K_IGNORE keycode does not work after version 7.2.025)
      " there are numerous other keysequences that you can use

    - The trick with K_IGNORE does not work anymore after version 7.2.025 
      (Oct-2008). You need to use different sequence of keys. Ref:

    - How about if Vim is in Insert mode for a while? - In Insert mode, you can 
      harness |CursorHoldI| and |CursorMovedI| in addition to |CursorHold| and 
      |CursorMoved|; but the risk of interference remains with other uses of these 
      events, or with the original use of 'updatetime' to write the swap file. 
    - vim 8 has 'real' timer support.No need to fake timer.

==============================================================================

I generally liked the warnings that Vim gives when a file changes outside of 
the editor. However, there are times when I want to run a shell command that 
changes the buffer, and I don't want to hear about it.

I've come up with the following convoluted method to do this, but if there's 
a better way, I'd love to know.

>
    function ChangeThisBuffer
      "set an environment variable to current buffer name
      let $aucfile = expand( "%" )
      "add autocmd which only applies to this buffer which removes itself once it runs once
      autocmd FileChangedShell $aucfile autocmd! FileChangedShell $aucfile
      execute( 'silent !mycommand' )
    endfunction
<

One problem with this approach is that if the shell command fails, or doesn't 
really change the file, then you won't be notified the next time it changes.

Untested, but this sounds like it would work/is what you are after.
    - :help 'autoread' 


>
    function ChangeThisBuffer
      setlocal autoread
      execute( 'silent !mycommand' )
      set autoread<
    endfunction
<

==============================================================================

To avoid the problem with the autocommand not being removed, you could 
explicity remove it in the function instead of relying on the autocommand 
itself to do so. Here's what I have in some of my functions:

>
    checktime
    exe "au FileChangedShell " . expand("%") . " let &cpo = &cpo"
    " Do stuff to the file.
    checktime
    exe "au! FileChangedShell " . expand("%")
<

The "let &cpo = &cpo" command is just a convenient no-op.

I was really annoyed by the lack of Vim support by the FTP applications found 
on Mac OS X. None of them support Vim as an external editor. But there is a 
solution.

Download FTPeel (http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/products/ftpeel/ 
[http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/products/ftpeel/]). It's a great FTP app 
that has a feature called MagicMirror.

Here is it how it works:

Well - This features also works from Vim. That is, you open a local file, 
edit it and press some shortcuts to paste the file to FTPeel -- and FTPeel 
does its work.

FTPeel had a bug, but I have manually fixed it.

Here is what you need to add to your vimrc:

>
    " FTPeel MagicMirror support
    fun! MagicMirrorIt()
      let path = substitute(expand("%:p"), '/', ":", "g")
      let nice_path = substitute(path, "^:", "", "")
      execute('!osascript -e "tell application \"FTPeel\" to open \"' . nice_path . '\""')
    endfun
    map <C-S> :call MagicMirrorIt()<CR>
<

First set up FTPeel. Then open your local file and when you want to upload it 
on the world wide web -- just hit Control-s

==============================================================================

Here's a (what should be a one-line) map to help you tell just what syntax 
highlighting groups the item under the cursor actually is:

>
    map <F10> :echo "hi<" . synIDattr(synID(line("."),col("."),1),"name") . '> trans<'
    \ . synIDattr(synID(line("."),col("."),0),"name") . "> lo<"
    \ . synIDattr(synIDtrans(synID(line("."),col("."),1)),"name") . ">"<CR>
<

Once known you can override the current highlighting with whatever you want.

If you're debugging a syntax highlighting file (a rare occupation), sometimes 
you'll wish to know the entire chain of syntax highlighting. For that, see 
HiLinkTrace [http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#HILINKS].

Example: Looking at the syntax/vim.vim file's

>
    syn match vimSpecFile "<c\(word\|WORD\)>" nextgroup=...
<

Put the cursor on the "\(" in the string, press F10:

>
    hi<vimPatSep> trans<vimPatSep> lo<Special>
<

will show up on the status line. You may envisage the highlighting as a 
push-down stack of highlighting groups. The "highest" one is the most limited 
in scope, and is the name of the syntax keyword, match, or region. Generally 
such a syntax group is linked to a highlighting group. The "lowest" one is the 
basic highlighting specification, and probably has a broad reach -- in this 
case, "Special" is a default highlighting group used in 179 syntax 
highlighting files (vim 6.0) for a variety of purposes.

Syntax groups can be specified as being transparent, so that whatever group 
they're in is what is used for highlighting. If that's the case, the group 
mentioned in "trans<>" will be the name of that group, else it is a repeat of 
the "hi<>" group name.

With the highlighting script (hilinks.vim), you'll get (via \hlt):

>
    vimPatSep -> SpecialChar -> Special
<

which shows the entire highlighting chain. Thus, a "\(" is identified as 
being highlighted as a vimPatSep, which is a link to SpecialChar, which itself 
is a link to Special. Actually a "\(" is a vimPatSepZone region which has 
vimPatSep as its "matchgroup".

==============================================================================

This tip is supposed to provide an easy way to synchronize the current 
directory between a Vim session and a shell. The most naive approach is to 
simply build a command for changing to the current directory in Vim, and then 
paste and execute that command within your shell. This is the approach we take 
here. The following command line places a string of the form `cd "<current 
directory"` in the paste register (@+):

>
    let @+="cd \"" . escape(getcwd(), "\"") . "\""
<

Here, we escape any double-quote characters in the path name because quotes 
are used in the string itself as argument delimiters. You could then map this 
to a key sequence or use it in other ways. I've chosen to make it the 
definition for a command, as follows:

>
    com Scd let @+="cd \"" . escape(getcwd(), "\"") . "\""
<

"Scd" could stand for "Save current directory" or "Shell cd". Of course, you 
could use a different name entirely. If you wanted to generate a 'cd' command 
for the directory of the current file, instead of the current working 
directory, you could use 'expand("%:p:h")' instead of 'getcwd()' in the above 
expressions, as mentioned in VimTip64 |vtw-64|. I like to keep the two actions 
separate, so I have another command for quickly changing to the directory of 
the current file:

>
    com Fcd cd %:p:h
<

Where "Fcd" could stand for "File current directory".

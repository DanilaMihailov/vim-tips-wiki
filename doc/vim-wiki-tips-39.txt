==============================================================================

To undo recent changes, from normal mode use the undo command:
    - u: undo last change (can be repeated to undo preceding commands) 
    - Ctrl-r: Redo changes which were undone (undo the undos). Compare to . to 
      repeat a previous change, at the current cursor position. Ctrl-r (hold down 
      Ctrl and press r) will redo a previously undone change, wherever the change 
      occurred. 


A related command is:
    - U: return the last line which was modified to its original state (reverse all 
      changes in last modified line) 


U is not actually a true "undo" command as it does not actually navigate undo 
history like u and Ctrl-r. This means that (somewhat confusingly) U is itself 
undo-able with u; it creates a new change to reverse previous changes.

U is seldom useful in practice, but is often accidentally pressed instead of 
u, so it is good to know about.

UNDO TREE                                                   *vwt-39-undo-tree*

Note that unlike most programs which maintain a linear undo history, Vim 
maintains an undo tree containing every edit made to a buffer. To learn how to 
use Vim's undo tree, see the separate article on using undo branches 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Using_undo_branches].

UNDO STACK                                                 *vwt-39-undo-stack*

Note that a single Insert session (invoked by pressing i) is considered as 
one entry in the undo stack. That is, if you entered 10 lines in a single 
Insert session, then pressed Esc, invoking undo will delete those 10 lines (as 
opposed to undoing only the the previous line, which is usually the case in 
most code editors).

==============================================================================

If you like to generate tags for a whole project and keep tags up-to-date, 
you might want to use this plugin: script#3221 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3221].

==============================================================================

To automatically update the ctags file when a file is written, add this to 
your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    function! DelTagOfFile(file)
      let fullpath = a:file
      let cwd = getcwd()
      let tagfilename = cwd . "/tags"
      let f = substitute(fullpath, cwd . "/", "", "")
      let f = escape(f, './')
      let cmd = 'sed -i "/' . f . '/d" "' . tagfilename . '"'
      let resp = system(cmd)
    endfunction
    
    function! UpdateTags()
      let f = expand("%:p")
      let cwd = getcwd()
      let tagfilename = cwd . "/tags"
      let cmd = 'ctags -a -f ' . tagfilename . ' --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q ' . '"' . f . '"'
      call DelTagOfFile(f)
      let resp = system(cmd)
    endfunction
    autocmd BufWritePost *.cpp,*.h,*.c call UpdateTags()

To run a command in the background you may try script script#1582 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1582].

==============================================================================

Since I wrote it, I prefer script#1343 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1343].

The big advantage, that I see, is that simply running `ctags -a` on a written 
file leaves behind in the tags file tags for items you've just deleted before 
writing the file. Script 1343 removes all entries for the file you've just 
written and then runs `ctags -a`.

[meta comment: the script presented here also removes deleted entries before 
appending new ones.]

==============================================================================

I refactored the script as our style is two-space indents. There is no need 
to "unlet" local variables, and simple names (no tricky underscores) is best. 
The new function (DelTagOfFile) invokes sed, and that needs explanation (it's 
only installed on some systems, and why not use Vim). I have just done routine 
cleanups and haven't thought about what the code is doing (and haven't tested 
it). JohnBeckett [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:JohnBeckett] (talk

You can also achieve this with easytags 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3114] using this command:

>
    autocmd BufWritePost * exe ":UpdateTags"

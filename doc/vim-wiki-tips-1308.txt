INTRODUCTION                                           *vwt-1308-introduction*

The conceal patch by Vince Negri allows one to "conceal" parts of lines 
(in-line folding). One can make those parts completely invisible or replace 
them with shorter/alternate characters. Uses for this patch include:
    - Creating vertical folds (folding visual blocks or columns). See the 
      foldcol.vim script 
      [http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=1161], which uses the 
      conceal patch to achieve this. 
    - Hiding certain "distracting" characters, like ANSI escape sequences. See the 
      AnsiEsc.vim script 
      [http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=302]. (Although it 
      seems the conceal version of the script has been replaced with one using 
      "ignore" highlighting.) 
    - Hiding or altering HTML tags. For example "Text in <b>bold</b>" can appear as 
      "Text in *bold*", or simply as "Text in bold". 


When used with color highlighting, conceal can be a very useful feature, 
allowing one to see the bare text in an HTML or LaTeX document without the 
clutter of markup.

This is achieved by making/altering a vim syntax file and using the "conceal" 
argument to specify which keywords, regions, or patterns can be concealed or 
replaced with different characters. Then one sets the "conceallevel" option to 
turn the concealing on or off.

Without the conceal patch, the only way to achieve a similar effect is to use 
ignore highlighting to toggle the visibility of certain markup. However, this 
is effectively equivalent to making the color of the markup match the 
background of the text editor. The markup still takes up space and can be seen 
when selected. The conceal patch, on the other hand, brings a whole new level 
of control over how Vim displays text.

The conceal patch also comes with two features useful in situations beyond 
concealing text. The ownsyntax option allows for two or more windows of the 
same file to use different syntax files. This allows one to view the same 
document with different highlighting. The other, related feature, cursorbind, 
is similar to scrollbind and allows two or more windows to remain in sync as 
one of them scrolls (useful for diff-ing documents).

WHERE TO GET IT                                     *vwt-1308-where-to-get-it*

The conceal patch is not officially supported by Vim (to change this, vote 
[http://www.vim.org/sponsor/vote_results.php] for the patch). No pre-compiled 
binaries of Vim with the patch can easily be found on the web (except for this 
experimental binary:Gvim 7.0.17 
[http://vince.negri.googlepages.com/GVIM16.zip], native 16-bit Windows build). 
This means that one has to compile Vim from the source code and apply the 
patch manually.

The patch can be downloaded at: http://vince.negri.googlepages.com/ 
[http://vince.negri.googlepages.com/]

Also see Vince Negri's description of the patch 
[http://vince.negri.googlepages.com/concealownsyntaxforvim], showing its use 
for abbreviating a LaTeX document.

INSTALLING THE PATCH ON UNIX/LINUX *vwt-1308-installing-the-patch-on-unix/linux*

Currently, the patch is only available for Vim 6.4.10 and 7.0.35.I personally 
have had trouble building 7.0.35 on Ubuntu Gutsy (see Appendix C 
|vwt-1308-appendix-c:-compile-errors|), though 6.4.10 compiles fine. If you 
have trouble building one of the versions, try the other.

PATCHING AND BUILDING                         *vwt-1308-patching-and-building*

In order to build Vim, several development packages and libraries will need 
to be installed. On Ubuntu systems make sure you at least have the 
build-essential and libncurses5-dev packages installed. To compile Vim with 
GUI support, you'll also need libgtk2.0-dev, libxaw7-dev, and libx11-dev 
(should already be installed). You may also want libgnome2-dev and 
libgnomeui-dev, but it seems to compile on GNOME fine without these.

>
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev libgtk2.0-dev libxaw7-dev libx11-dev
<

Other packages may also be necessary. If you need other packages, configure 
(see below) should warn you about missing packages.

Next, create a directory for building Vim.

>
    mkdir ~/.build
<

Move the downloaded source files into ~/.build and unpack them. For example 
(if you're building Vim 6.4):

>
    tar xvfj vim-6.4.tar.bz2
    tar xvfz vim-6.4-extra.tar.gz
<

...and so on.The sources will extract to ~/.build/vim64.

Create a ~/.build/vim64/patches folder and move the patches there. Now start 
patching the sources from the ~/.build/vim64 directory.

>
    patch -p0 patches/6.4.002
    patch -p0 patches/6.4.003
    ...
    patch -p0 patches/6.4.009
<

Go through the patches one-by-one, in ascending order, skipping the extra 
patches if you're not installing the extra sources.This can be a long process, 
so you may want to use the code in the script provided in Appendix A 
|vwt-1308-appendix-a:-scripts-to-download-sources-and-build-vim|.Now you can 
apply the conceal patch. For Vim 6.4:

>
    patch -p0 patches/conceal-ownsyntax-v64.diff
<

or for Vim 7.0:

>
    patch -p0 patches/conceal-ownsyntax.diff
<

Watch for any errors. If everything went well, you can now run configure. You 
will at minimum need to enable the conceal and huge features:

>
    ./configure --enable-conceal --with-features=huge
<

However, if you want to be able to use a GUI (i.e. gvim), you will need to 
enable a few more features. These options should work on Ubuntu Gutsy:

>
    ./configure --enable-conceal --with-features=huge --with-x --enable-gui=gtk2 --enable-gnome-check --x-includes=/usr/include/X11 --x-libraries=/usr/lib
<

You may want other options enabled as well (for example --enable-multibyte 
for Asian character languages). Type ./configure --help to see what other 
features/packages are available. Then search the Vim documentation 
|http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/help.html| for more information on each 
feature (in particular see various.txt 
|http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/various.html|).If you get errors, you 
are probably missing a required development package. Try to discern the error 
to figure out what you need. (Googling the text of the error often helps).

Now you can compile the code. If you're going to install the compiled Vim 
binary into your system, simply run make, then make install, and you're done.

>
    make
    make install
<

However, there are many reasons for not installing this patched version of 
Vim directly into your system. You may want to keep a more up-to-date, stabler 
version as the default Vim binary. Also, installing the binary directly can 
cause problems because it's not packaged specifically for your system (like it 
would be with apt-get install vim). You would also need to uninstall your 
current Vim package first, but it can be difficult to completely remove Vim on 
many systems, like Ubuntu Linux. It is possible to have two versions of Vim 
installed on your system [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/VimTip848], but it's a 
bit complicated.

A simpler solution is to leave the Vim binary in the build directory and then 
create a symbolic link to it. This will let you keep your existing version of 
Vim, while giving you the option of using your patched version of Vim when you 
need to. If you're choosing this route, you'll need to pass the runtime 
directory of the build to make (see ~/.build/vim64/src/INSTALL for more 
information). For example:

>
    make VIMRUNTIMEDIR=~/.build/vim70/runtime MAKE="make -e"
<

This is necessary so that your patched Vim doesn't try to look for the 
runtime files in /usr/share/vim and instead looks in its own runtime 
directory.

If the make compilation finished without errors, you should now see a Vim 
binary in ~/.build/vim64/src/vim. Check to see if it compiled with the conceal 
feature.

>
    ~/.build/vim64/src/vim --version
<

You should see a +conceal feature listed in the output. If it says -conceal 
then conceal is not installed and something went wrong.

You can now start Vim with conceal! Just type ./vim or ./vim -g for GUI mode.

If you didn't run make install, then you can create a symbolic link to the 
built Vim binary for easy access on the command line. You should call the 
links something different from vim, gvim, vim.full, etc.

>
    sudo ln -s ~/.build/vim64/src/vim /usr/bin/cvim
    sudo ln -s ~/.build/vim64/src/vim /usr/bin/gcvim
<

Here we made two links to the Vim binary, gcvim and cvim (conceal-Vim). 
Because the gcvim link starts with a "g", it will automatically launch Vim in 
GUI mode (same as vim -g).

You can also create symbolic links to your syntax files, so that both Vim 
binaries can use it. For example:

>
    sudo ln -s /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/syntax/my_syntax.vim ~/.build/vim64/runtime/syntax/my_syntax.vim
<

Since you'll be using the same .vimrc / .gvimrc files for two Vim binaries 
with different version numbers, you will get errors when setting newer 
features with the older binary. To get around this, check the version number 
in your .vimrc file.

>
    if version > 604
        set cursorline
    endif
<

This way, Vim will only run the command cursorline if the version number is 
greater than Vim 6.4.

USING CONCEAL                                         *vwt-1308-using-conceal*

Here's a quick look at how to use the features available in the conceal 
patch.First, let's make a syntax file.

>
    "chtml.vim: html with conceal
    set conc=2
    
    syn region inBold concealends matchgroup=bTag start="<b>" end="</b>"
    syn match newLine "<br>" conceal cchar=}
    
    hi inBold gui=bold
    hi bTag guifg=blue
    hi newLine guifg=green
<

Call this file chtml.vim and place it in /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/syntax/ or 
similar syntax directory.Next, create a simple HTML file, hello.chtml:

Here is some <b>bold</b> HTML!<br>

Edit this file with Vim (patched with conceal). Now to apply the syntax file, 
you'll need to source it. From Vim run:

>
    :so /path/to/chtml.vim
<

You can also automatically apply the chtml.vim syntax file to files ending in 
.chtml by adding this line to .vimrc:

>
    autocmd BufRead *.chtml set filetype=chtml
<

You should now see the tags highlighted.

Here is some bold HTML!

Now we can conceal the tags by using the conceallevel option:

>
    :set conceallevel=2
<

(Or :se conc=2 for short). The HTML will now look like this:

Here is some HTML!

Let's look at how this works.Setting the conceallevel option to "2" hides 
concealed text or replaces it with another character. In this case the <b> 
tags are hidden and the <br> tags are replaced with the shorter "}" character.

This is dictated by the syntax file. The conceal argument indicates that the 
"<br>" match is concealable. The cchar argument provides an alternate 
character that can be shown in place of "<br>". The cchar argument is 
optional; if it isn't present then the concealed text is simply hidden when 
the conceallevel is set to "2".

The concealends argument allows for the start and end portions of a region to 
be concealed, while the inner text remains unconcealed. You need to provide a 
matchgroup argument that will create a group name for the start and end 
patterns, which can then be highlighted differently.

You can also set conceallevel to "3", which will hide all the concealable 
tags, ignoring the cchar alternate characters. Or you can set conceallevel to 
"1", which will replace all the concealable tags with a "-" (dash), aside from 
the cchar tags. To go back to unconcealed text, set concellevel to "0". You 
can quickly toggle concealed text by mapping :se conc=0 and :se conc=2 to two 
different keys. You can also start the file in a concealed mode on opening it 
by putting set conc=2 in your syntax file.

Note that the text of the line on which the cursor is on is never concealed. 
There seems to be no way to avoid this, even though it would certainly be 
useful in many cases to leave all text concealed while editing around the 
concealed portions. However, it is possible to see the full unconcealed text 
in a separate window from the one you're working on. To do this, start by 
splitting the window.

>
    :split
<

You can jump from window to window by using "CTRL-W-W". Then simply set the 
conceallevel to "0" in one window and "2" in the other.

One issue you'll quickly notice is that the two windows won't always be in 
sync when you start scrolling up and down. To address this, the conceal patch 
comes with another option -- cursorbind. Simply enter:

>
    :se cursorbind
<

Now the two windows will be in sync, both by line and column. Note that 
cursorbind (crb) is similar to scrollbind (scb), which comes with Vim. There 
are slight differences between the two -- for instance using CTRL-Y and CTRL-E 
will scroll both windows with scrollbind, but not with cursorbind.

Finally, you can use the ownsyntax option that comes with the conceal patch 
to use different syntax files for the two windows (normally you can't use two 
syntax styles on the same file in Vim). You can use this to create one style 
of highlighting for the concealed markup-free version of the document, while 
using another for the window with markup. This also lets you keep the conceal 
version of your syntax file separate from the standard syntax file.

For instance, with our sample html document, you can split the windows and 
apply two different styles. To use the html.vim syntax file for the first 
window, simply enter:

>
    :ownsyntax html
<

Then switch to the other window and apply the chtml.vim syntax file:

>
    :ownsyntax chtml
<

Or, alternatively, enter :ownsyntax in both windows and you'll be able to 
source a separate syntax file in each window.

For the complete details, see the conceal documentation in Vim help (Appendix 
B |vwt-1308-appendix-b:-vim-help-documentation-for-conceal|).

APPENDIX A: SCRIPTS TO DOWNLOAD SOURCES AND BUILD VIM *vwt-1308-appendix-a:-scripts-to-download-sources-and-build-vim*

Here are two sets of scripts that summarize and automate the install process 
described above. I don't recommend running these scripts the first time you 
build Vim because so many things can go wrong. Rather, once you can patch and 
build Vim without problems, you can tweak these scripts and use them to 
rebuild Vim when necessary. The one part of the scripts you may want to use 
the first time you're building is the loop for downloading/applying the 
patches.

These scripts don't use the 'extra' and 'language' sources, but they can 
easily be modified to do so. Also, the scripts don't install Vim, but rather 
make a symbolic link to the new Vim binary.

Copy and paste each script into a text file. Then make it executable and run 
it from ~/.build. First run the get script to download the sources; then run 
the go script to build.

    	When this option is set, as the cursor in the current
    	window moves other cursorbound windows (windows that also have
    	this option set) move their cursors to the corresponding line and
    	column.  This option is useful for viewing the
    	differences between two versions of a file (see 'diff'); in diff mode,
    	inserted and deleted lines (though not characters within a line) are
    	taken into account.

    16. Window-local syntax				*:ownsyntax*
    
    Normally all windows on a buffer share the same syntax settings. It is
    possible, however, to set a particular window on a file to have its own
    private syntax setting. A possible example would be to edit LaTeX source
    with conventional highlighting in one window, while seeing the same source
    highlighted differently (so as to hide control sequences and indicate bold,
    italic etc regions) in another. The 'scrollbind' option is useful here.
    
    To set the current window to have the syntax "foo", separately from all other
    windows on the buffer: >
       :ownsyntax foo
    
    Once a window has its own syntax, syntax commands executed from other windows
    on the same buffer (including :syntax clear) have no effect. Conversely,
    syntax commands executed from that window do not effect other windows on the
    same buffer.
    
    A window with its own syntax reverts to normal behaviour when another buffer
    is loaded into that window.
<

>
    6. :syntax arguments					*:syn-arguments*
    
    The :syntax commands that define syntax items take a number of arguments.
    The common ones are explained here.  The arguments may be given in any order
    and may be mixed with patterns.
    
    Not all commands accept all arguments.	This table shows which arguments
    can not be used for all commands:
    							*E395* *E396*
    		    contains  oneline	fold  display  extend concealends~
    :syntax keyword		 -	 -	 -	 -	 -      -
    :syntax match		yes	 -	yes	yes	yes     -
    :syntax region		yes	yes	yes	yes	yes    yes
    
    These arguments can be used for all three commands:
    	conceal
    	cchar
    	contained
    	containedin
    	nextgroup
    	transparent
    	skipwhite
    	skipnl
    	skipempty
    
    conceal							*:syn-conceal*
    
    When the "conceal" argument is given, the item is marked as concealable.
    Whether or not it is actually concealed depends on the setting on the
    'conceallevel' option.
    
    concealends						*:syn-concealends*
    
    When the "concealends" argument is given, the start and end matches of
    the region, but not the contents of the region, are marked as concealable.
    Whether or not they are actually concealed depends on the setting on the
    'conceallevel' option. The ends of a region can only be concealed separately
    in this way when they have their own highlighting via "matchgroup"
    
    cchar							*:syn-cchar*
    
    The "cchar" argument defines the character shown in place of the item
    when it is concealed (setting "cchar" only makes sense when the conceal
    argument is given.) If "cchar" is not set then the default conceal
    character defined in the 'listchars' option is used. Example: >
       :syntax match Entity "&" conceal cchar=&
<

>
    IMPLICIT CONCEAL					*:syn-conceal-implicit*
    
    :sy[ntax] conceal [on|off]
    	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will define keywords,
    	matches or regions with the "conceal" flag set. After ":syn conceal
    	on", all subsequent ":syn keyword", ":syn match" or ":syn region"
    	defined will have the "conceal" flag set implicitly. ":syn conceal
    	off" returns to the normal state where the "conceal" flag must be
    	given explicitly.
<

>
    *highlight-groups* *highlight-default*
    These are the default highlighting groups.  These groups are used by the
    'highlight' option default.  Note that the highlighting depends on the value
    of 'background'.  You can see the current settings with the ":highlight"
    command.
    							*hl-Conceal*
    Conceal		placeholder characters substituted for concealed
    		text (see 'conceallevel')
    
            <--- cut --->

EVAL.TXT                                                   *vwt-1308-eval.txt*

>
    *window-variable* *w:var*
    A variable name that is preceded with "w:" is local to the current window.  It
    is deleted when the window is closed.
    
    One local window variable is predefined:
    					*w:ownsyntax-variable* *ownsyntax*
    w:ownsyntax	Set to 1 if the window has an independent syntax installed
    		via the |:ownsyntax| command. The default for a window is
    		0. Syntax scripts can use this to determine whether they
    		should set b:current_syntax or w:current_syntax.

APPENDIX C: COMPILE ERRORS               *vwt-1308-appendix-c:-compile-errors*

I personally have not been able to compile Vim 7.0.35 with the conceal patch 
on Ubuntu Gutsy.All the patches work and configure runs fine, but make gives 
the following error:

>
    ...
    gcc -c -I. -Iproto -DHAVE_CONFIG_H     -g -O2         -o objects/option.o option.c
    option.c:795: error: ‘WV_CONCEAL’ undeclared here (not in a function)
    option.c:886: error: ‘WV_CRBIND’ undeclared here (not in a function)
    option.c: In function ‘get_varp’:
    option.c:9032: error: case label does not reduce to an integer constant
    option.c:9035: error: case label does not reduce to an integer constant
    make[1]: *** [objects/option.o] Error 1
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/user/.build/vim70/src'
    make: *** [first] Error 2
<

This error doesn't happen when compiling Vim 6.4.10 on the same system. Can 
someone resolve the cause of this error?If anyone has success compiling Vim 
7.0.35 on Ubuntu Gutsy, please post your findings.

APPENDIX D: REQUEST FOR MORE INFORMATION *vwt-1308-appendix-d:-request-for-more-information*

Please post your findings to these issues:
    - What development packages are required on other distros besides Ubuntu? 
    - What is the cause of the error when making Vim 7.0.35 on Ubuntu Gutsy (see 
      Appendix C |vwt-1308-appendix-c:-compile-errors|)? 
    - Is there any way (proper solution or hack) to avoid the unconcealment of the 
      line on which the cursor is on? 
    - Post any useful syntax files you've made that use conceal on vim.org and link 
      them here.

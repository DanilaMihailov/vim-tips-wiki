==============================================================================

Vim can be used to detect the file encoding used in a particular file (for 
example, utf-8, utf-16le, or latin1). This tip shows an alias to invoke Vim 
with suitable arguments to check the encoding used for a specified file.

BASH SHELL ALIAS  *vwt-1641-bash-shell-alias*

Here is a simple alias for the Bash shell 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)] to display what Vim thinks is 
a file's encoding:

>
    alias vimenc='vim -c '\''let $enc = &fileencoding | execute "!echo Encoding:  $enc" | q'\'''
<

This saves having to open Vim, then open the file and check the file 
encoding, and exit. The alias requires a file as a parameter.

Usage examples:

>
    $ vimenc UTF-16.xml
    Encoding: utf-16le
    Press ENTER or type command to continue
    
    $ vimenc ISO-8859-1.xml
    Encoding: latin1
    Press ENTER or type command to continue
<

EXPLANATION  *vwt-1641-explanation*

When an existing file is read, Vim tries to interpret the bytes in the file 
as characters using each encoding specified in the 'fileencodings' option. The 
first encoding that produces no conversion error is used, and that encoding is 
reported as the file encoding by the alias shown above.

After using the global 'fileencodings' option to determine the file encoding, 
Vim stores the result in the buffer local option 'fileencoding' (the first 
option is plural, ending with an 's'; the second option is singular). In the 
alias, the let $enc = &fileencoding statement assigns the value of 
'fileencoding' to an environment variable named enc (the '$' tells Vim to set 
an environment variable which is displayed by the echo command of the shell).

When the 'encoding' option is set to a Unicode value such as utf-8, the 
default for 'fileencodings' is "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1" which will 
check, in order:

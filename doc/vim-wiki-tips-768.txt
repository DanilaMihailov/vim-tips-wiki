Say I have a file that was loaded with:

>
    :view ~/thud/foo/bar.c
<

I now want to save it as, say ~/thud/foo/bar.c.txt

This can be done using these commands.

>
    command! -nargs=1 AddExt execute "saveas ".expand("%:p").<q-args>
    command! -nargs=1 ChgExt execute "saveas ".expand("%:p:r").<q-args>
<

The following saves the current buffer's file as the current buffer's 
filename with '.c' appended.

>
    :AddExt .c
<

The following saves the current buffer's file as the current buffer's 
filename with the extension changed to '.txt'.

>
    :ChgExt .txt
<

    :w %:p.txt will save the file with .txt added after the existing extension.
    :w %:p:r.txt will replace the extension with txt.

Speaking up for mnemonics, some people, newbies especially, have trouble 
remembering !/*%^, much less, what it may or may not mean. I, for one, find 
ChgExt easier to remember, not only for use, but for meaning, than w 
%:p:r.<ext>. When I see the command in my vimrc 2 years from now, I won't have 
any trouble using it or remembering what it's for. Nor will I have to say, 
'Let's see, I did that once 2 years ago... gosh, I'll just look it up again in 
:h expand' (if I remember that I need to look in :h expand). Let's not loose 
track of one of the major strongpoints of commands: they make tasks easier. 
It's the same reason things like aliases and functions exist in shells.

Now if you want to change the command to say something like

>
    command! -nargs=1 ChgExt :w %:p:r.<args>
<

that's another matter. But to say 'use this anti-mnemonic formula instead of 
the command' is not very helpful.

Also, the original question was how to ':saveas' not ':w'. One changes the 
buffer to the new file, the other does not. So, to be correct, the command 
should be

>
    command! -nargs=1 ChgExt :saveas %:p:r.<args>
<

If you have a mind for anti-mnemonics and the like, great! But don't forget 
many people don't.

One alternative:

>
    :w %<.txt
<

will write to ~/thud/foo/bar.txt

think of a '<' as 'some backspaces' :help |<>|
    - :help  |extension-removal|

==============================================================================

Tips relating to the Clojure [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure] language 
will be given here.

COMMENTING AND UNCOMMENTING             *vwt-1631-commenting-and-uncommenting*

The comment leader for Clojure is the `;` character. This snippet allows easy 
commenting and uncommenting of lines.

>
    map <Leader>. :call ClojureCommentUncomment()<CR>
    function! ClojureCommentUncomment()
      let search_saved = @/
      if getline('.') =~ '^;'
        s/^;//  " remove ';' at beginning of line
      else
        s/^/;/  " insert ';' at beginning of line
      endif
      let @/ = search_saved
    endfunction
<

Typing `\.` (assuming the default backslash leader) will remove `;` from the 
beginning of the current line if it is present (uncomment), or will insert it 
otherwise (comment). You could make this more restrictive by only adding the 
mapping for files of the Clojure filetype, or by adding it to 
`~/.vim/after/ftplugin/clojure.vim`.

REFERENCES                                               *vwt-1631-references*
    - :help |filetype| 
    - :help |after-directory| 


COMMENTS                                                   *vwt-1631-comments*

TO DO
    - May need some information similar to VimTip1565 |vwt-1565| for making Clojure 
      a known filetype. 
    - The tip used '\;' but the backslash is redundant (I removed it). 
    - The tip had if getline('.') =~ '\;' but `s/^;//`. The former matches `;` 
      anywhere in the line, while the latter only matches at the left margin. I 
      changed it. 


Please fix it if my changes broke anything. JohnBeckett

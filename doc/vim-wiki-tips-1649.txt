==============================================================================

If you work in different environments, each with its own different coding 
standards and rules, then your projects are going to be in separate 
directories that usually do not interact with each other. You can use that to 
let Vim know, from the path in which the projects reside, what rules to apply 
for each individual project.

For example, you might have a few projects with the following details:
    - The first project resides in `/home/user/projects/Project1`, and the rules 
      state that tabs should be replaced with 4 spaces in all files that are not 
      YAML, and with 2 spaces in YAML files. 
    - All other projects reside in `/home/user/projects` and have the rules that 
      tabs remain tabs in all files, and they should be treated as being equal with 
      4 spaces. 


To accommodate the above scenario, you could define an `autocmd` in your 
vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] for switching between rules, 
depending on the file path:

>
    function! SetupEnvironment()
      let l:path = expand('%:p')
      if l:path =~ '/home/user/projects/Project1'
        setlocal expandtab smarttab textwidth=0
        if &filetype == 'yaml'
          setlocal tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2
        else
          setlocal tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4
        endif
      elseif l:path =~ '/home/user/projects'
        setlocal tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 noexpandtab
      endif
    endfunction
    autocmd! BufReadPost,BufNewFile * call SetupEnvironment()

Just a few of them are listed here:
    - local_vimrc [https://github.com/LucHermitte/local_vimrc]

Alternatively, if you tend to start Vim from the root of my "project" 
directory, you can simply add following into .vimrc:

silent! so .vimlocal

This allows putting a file `.vimlocal` in a project root directory, where one 
can set additional options or override defaults from .vimrc. Thanks to 
`!silent`, it will be simply ignored if there is no `.vimlocal` file in the 
directory you start vim from.

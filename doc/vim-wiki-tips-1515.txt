==============================================================================

This tip is about enabling the use of all characters in a Hungarian keymap, 
but the idea may be useful for other languages as well, hence the title.

There are four different Hungarian keymaps, depending on the infamous y-z key 
swap and the number of keys on the keyboard (101 or 102). For 101-key 
keyboards there is no separate 0 (zero) key, it is accessible by Alt-i'. The 
Happy Hacking Keyboard has a layout similar to 101 keys, so this must be used 
there as well.

Important punctuation characters are accessible with mappings using the Alt 
key, so we have to disable menu-shortcuts using the Alt key with the following 
setting.

>
    :set winaltkeys=no
<

If this setting is enabled, we can define the missing keys. Here are the most 
important ones:

>
    " Combinations accessible with the Alt key
    <M-`> 0
    <M-q> \
    <M-w> |
    <M-f> [
    <M-g> ]
    <M-x> #
    <M-c> &
    <M-v> @
    <M-b> {
    <M-n> }
    <M-m> <
    <M-.> >
    <M-,> ;
<

These lines can be appended to your 
`$VIM/vimfiles/keymap/magyar_utf-8.keymap` file.

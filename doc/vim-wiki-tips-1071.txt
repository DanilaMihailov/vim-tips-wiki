==============================================================================

I was very impressed with the functionality of placeholders in the 
Latex-Suite script#475 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=475], 
so I decided to add a similiar functionality to my vimrc.

>
    " A syntax for placeholders
    " Pressing Control-j jumps to the next match.
    inoremap <c-j> <Esc>/<++><CR><Esc>cf>
<

You could of course use any key-sequence for this. I use it with my code for 
() completion. It can be equally well used with templates and other 
abbreviations.

>
    " Completions using placeholders
    inoremap ( ()<++><Esc>F)i
    inoremap [ []<++><Esc>F]i
    inoremap { {}<++><Esc>F}i
<

This doesn't care if the code is entered free or if it's inside a block of 
text. In which case I think it should not expand. But I find it helpful none 
the less.Unlike the scripts pointed to by the comments this tip is just what 
it advertises. Simple.

Similar to this is markjump.vim script#485 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=485], in addition to others 
(the names of which escape me for now). Markjump adds a few advantages to this 
method such as not mangling the search pattern and providing previous and next 
jumps.

==============================================================================

You may have a look at what I produced in the API plugin script#50 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=50]. It already takes cares 
of what you are rewriting and much more. See also script#336 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=336] and mu-template (the 
fork I'm maintening provides a better integration of markers/placeholders) 
that fully integrate the bracketing system.

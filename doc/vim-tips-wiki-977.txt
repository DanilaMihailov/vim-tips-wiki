==============================================================================

It's possible to reformat an entire file, or a section of a file, using Vim's 
built-in |=| filter. Vim veterans often find this operator to be one of the 
most useful in their repertoire, but so common that it becomes second-nature 
and is rarely mentioned.

In normal mode, typing `gg=G` will reindent the entire file. This is a 
special case; `=` is an operator. Just like `d` or `y`, it will act on any 
text that you move over with a cursor motion command. In this case, `gg` 
positions the cursor on the first line, then `=G` re-indents from the current 
cursor position to the end of the buffer.

In visual mode, typing `=` will fix indentation of the current section. Thus, 
an equivalent but less efficient command to accomplish the same as `gg=G` in 
normal mode, would be `ggVG` to select the entire buffer in visual mode, 
followed by `=` to re-indent the entire selection.

The power of `=` is certainly not limited to the entire file. |==| will 
re-indent just the current line, or the `=` operator can be combined with 
|text-objects| for very powerful results.

If you often re-indent large areas (like the entire file, or a large text 
object), it can be useful to map a key to do it for you, using marks to 
restore your position. To format and return the same line where you were, just 
add this mapping to your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]:

>
    map <F7> gg=G<C-o><C-o>
<

Now, just press <F7> whenever you want to format your file.

Note, the `=` operator works using whatever automatic indentation settings 
you have turned on. If you don't have this set up, see indenting source code 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code] before using.

$VIMRUNTIME identifes a directory where Vim's support files are located. Many 
of the files are not necessary for Vim to run, but are used to provide extra 
functionality such as syntax highlighting and filetype-based plugins. Its 
value can be displayed in Vim with the command :echo $VIMRUNTIME. It is set 
using the procedure at :help |$VIMRUNTIME|.

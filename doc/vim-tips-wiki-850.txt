==============================================================================

You can set the text width for automatic word wrapping using `:set 
textwidth=n` (or `:set tw=n`) where n is a positive integer, for example:

>
    :set tw=79
<

That will automatically wrap text as close to 79 characters as white space 
allows without exceeding the 79 character limit. This option wraps at word 
boundaries.

Wrapping text using textwidth requires "t" in formatoptions, which it is by 
default. The following commands display the current setting then add "t" if 
needed. The abbreviation fo is used instead of formatoptions.

>
    :set fo?
    :set fo+=t
<

If a line is already longer than textwidth when insert mode is started, the 
line may not be wrapped even if text is added to the line. A long line is not 
wrapped when text is added if formatoptions contains "l". If needed, "l" can 
be removed so long lines will be wrapped:

>
    :set fo-=l
<

To stop automatic wrapping, unset textwidth using:

>
    :set tw=0
<

If you want to wrap lines in a specific area, move the cursor to the text you 
want to format and type `gq` followed by the range. For example, `gqq` wraps 
the current line and `gqip` wraps the current paragraph.

The following sets a wrap margin of 2 characters from the right window 
border. A system-dependent EOL character 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/File_format] is inserted and the line wraps as 
you type. This option may be useful in some situations, but probably is not 
what you are looking for.

>
    :set wm=2
<

The above methods do a "hard" wrap of your text, by inserting newline 
characters. An alternative method is a "soft" wrap which does not change the 
text but simply displays it on multiple lines. This can be achieved with:

>
    :set wrap linebreak
<

Note that this may lead to a bunch of screen lines being taken up by only a 
single "real" line, so commands like `j` and `k` which move on real lines will 
skip over a lot of screen lines. You can use `gj` and `gk` to move by screen 
lines.

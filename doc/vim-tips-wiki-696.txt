It drives me crazy that frequently when I click in a window, it goes into 
visual mode for a few characters and thus I can't type normal command mode 
commands. I'm finding I always have to press "v" to exit visual mode before I 
can use vim again.

I finally figured out how to disable visual mode using the mouse:

>
    noremap <LeftDrag> <LeftMouse>
    noremap! <LeftDrag> <LeftMouse>
<

In my vimrc:

>
    set mouse=nicr
<

No more visual mode from using mouse! :help 'mouse'

==============================================================================

That doesn't quite work, as the mouse still puts you into visual mode (which 
is really all I was trying to avoid).

Also, with my way, you can use Shift-LeftDrag to still select visual.

==============================================================================

What works for me is `:set mouse-=a`

==============================================================================If you want to have mouse=a enabled and still want to copy, On mac you can use press fn and select the area. Cmd+c and Cmd+v anywhere you want to.

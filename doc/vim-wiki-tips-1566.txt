It bothered me a bit that Ctrl-D in insert mode would just hop on multiples 
of shiftwidth when editing files with complex (and creative) indentation such 
as Haskell source files. I replaced <Ctrl-D> with the following Python 
function that scans the lines above the current one, finds the closest line 
that has strictly smaller indent and dedents the current one to that level.

    " Handy function to search previous lines for indent levels and
    " use those instead of multiples of shiftwidth.
    function! DedentToPrevious()
    python << EOF
    import vim
    tabsize = int(vim.eval("&ts"))
    l = vim.current.line
    rest = l.lstrip()
    indent = l[:-len(rest)]
    if indent != "":
        cur_size = len(indent.replace("\t", " "*tabsize))
        idx = vim.current.window.cursor[0]-2
        while idx >= 0:
            ll = vim.current.buffer[idx]
            indent = ll[:-len(ll.lstrip())]
            if len(indent.replace("\t", " "*tabsize)) < cur_size:
                vim.current.line = indent+rest
                break
            idx -= 1
    EOF
    endfunction
    
    " replace the <C-D> in insert mode with the above function
    imap <C-d> <C-o>:call DedentToPrevious()<CR>
    
    " To get more sane behaviour with auto-indent, use this instead:
    " imap <C-d> <Left><Right><C-o>:call DedentToPrevious()<CR>

TIPS FOR IMPROVEMENT  *vwt-1566-tips-for-improvement*If you are feeling adventurous, you could make a modified version that takes over the backspace key. I'd recommend using 

>
    vim.current.window.cursor
< to detect if the cursor is right between the indent whitespace and line contents (if any) and only use the above behavior in that case. All other cursor positions would need to have the normal backspace behavior.

COMMENTS  *vwt-1566-comments*

There is now a plugin, SofterTabstop 
[https://github.com/orbisvicis/SofterTabstop] that takes over the backspace 
key (among others), implementing this behaviour:
    - backspace: align to first previous dedent within count search lines up, down. 
    - tab: align to nearest next indent within intersection(adjacent lines of 
      deeper indentation, count search lines up, down). 
    - space: don't disable indentation alignment (default vim behavior) if editing 
      beyond indent. 


Alignment to multiples of shiftwidth (default vim behaviour) continues to be 
supported.

TO DO
    - The introduction to the tip is a little mysterious. A brief example of the 
      problem would be helpful. 
    - The comments below are from the author. They explain the need for the "To get 
      more sane behaviour" comment for the alternative mapping in the tip. However, 
      a quick test with Vim 7.2 and 7.0.40 on junk.py and junk.c failed to reproduce 
      the issue. 
    - Possibilities: Something clever that I've forgotten about on my system avoids 
      the problem, or, the problem does not exist on newish versions? 
    - The tip includes the suggestion in the comment near the bottom that starts "I 
      believe that the indent is also kept if you move the cursor about in the 
      line". 
    - Therefore, I think all the following (and this "todo") can be deleted. Any 
      opinions? --JohnBeckett [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/User:JohnBeckett] 00:47,

==============================================================================

When editing files in some kind of auto-indent (set ai, set cin etc.), vim 
behaves like this to the user:
    - End a line by pressing Enter 
    - Vim will determine the indent of the next line, either by using the previous 
      line's indent or by calling a language specific indent script. 
    - In the new line, the cursor appears to be at the correct indent preceded by 
      whitespace. 


In reality, the new line in the buffer is actually empty (there is no spoon.. 
sorry, whitespace). Thus, when a script asks for the line contents, it simply 
receives the empty string "" and not a string containing the indent 
whitespace. In the script above, this produces the following behaviour.

Say the user is editing a Python file, and the cursor is placed where the 
marker | is (not actually a part of the buffer):

>
    def some function:
        if condition:
            do_something()|
<

Now the user presses Enter and sees this:

>
    def some function:
        if condition:
            do_something()
            |
<

The user wants to reduce the indent by one fold, so instead of pressing 
backspace four times, she presses C-D. The script above kicks in and tries to 
determine the current line's indent. The user expects it to find eight spaces, 
triggering the search of above lines finding that the "one-less" indent is 
four spaces -- but what really happens is that the current line indent is 
computed as zero and the script sets that as the current indent, giving the 
user this:

>
    def some function:
        if condition:
            do_something()
    |
<

instead of the expected:

>
    def some function:
        if condition:
            do_something()
        |
<

Now, there is an ugly hack to solve this. After creating a new line, if the 
user types some character, say a space, and then deletes it immediately with 
backspace, the "fake" indent is turned into actual indent and C-D behaves as 
expected. The key-sequence for the above script can be modified to simply do 
this before each invocation of the script, i.e. the imap can be changed to:

>
    imap <C-d> <Space><BS><C-o>:call DedentToPrevious()<CR>
<

Perhaps this is an acceptable solution?

I believe that the indent is also kept if you move the cursor about in the line; you don't actually need to type any text. I think this will work, but haven't tested it: imap <C-d> <Left><Right><C-o>:call DedentToPrevious(<CR>

Yes, I tested it and just moving the cursor works fine. It is a little less ugly than inserting and removing text. Arnar 15:49, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

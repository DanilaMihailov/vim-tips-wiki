==============================================================================

Sometimes I want to use the file I'm editing in Vim (on Windows) in another 
application; I created the following command:

>
    command! Copyfile let @*=substitute(expand("%:p"), '/', '\', 'g')
<

This copies the entire path and filename of the current file (with any 
slashes replaced with backslashes) onto the clipboard. You can then paste the 
value wherever needed, such as a File, Open dialog.

As an addendum, I didn't want to make a mapping out of this because I don't 
do it often enough; however, one can easily do something like:

>
    :map <Leader>cf :Copyfile<CR>
<

I noticed that hitting :C<tab> was almost as fast as the mapping characters 
anyway.

==============================================================================

Here is my map to do the same thing:

>
    nn <silent><C-G> :let @*=expand('%:p')<CR>:f<CR>
<

I overloaded <C-G>, and because I set ssl, I don't need worry about 
backslash.

==============================================================================

The problem with your mapping is you're corrupting the clipboard every time 
you want to simply get information about where one is in the file. (I actually 
use Ctrl-g every so often and it would be nice if it didn't have a side 
effect.) Basically, for new users, overloading existing commands with side 
effects can become confusing and not intuitive.

The whole point of 'ssl' is to replace backslashes with FORWARD slashes. It 
doesn't help with pasting the filepath into another Windows application -- 
SOME of them may understand forward slashes but many will not, hence the 
substitution.

==============================================================================

To copy current file contents (rather than just the file name) to clipboard:

>
    :%y*
<

And map it, if you want:

>
    :map <F3> :%y*<CR>
<

File-content copying probably should be a separate tip altogether. Plus, it's 
not complete without a mention of the 'clipboard' and 'guioptions' options. 
Try :help |gui-clipboard| for more details.

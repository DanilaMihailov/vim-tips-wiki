==============================================================================

The command `:Explore` opens the file explorer window.

Select a file or directory name and press Enter to open that file or 
directory. (For example `:e /home/user` displays the contents of that 
directory.)

To return to the explorer window, press Ctrl-^ (usually Ctrl-6).

You can also "edit" a directory to explore that directory. For example, `:e 
..` lists files in the parent directory.

OTHER APPROACHES                                   *vwt-1182-other-approaches*

In normal mode, type `:e` then press Space and Ctrl-D. That will list file 
names in the current directory. You can type a name and press Enter to edit 
that file.

If, for example, you want a name that starts with "get" type `:e get` then 
press Tab repeatedly, or Ctrl-D to list all matches.

Another possibility is to use a mapping like this:

>
    map <F2> :!ls<CR>:e
<

I wonder if there is a way to navigate the files with case being insensitive 
after you press Ctrl-D

I have a bug with navigation: sometimes FileExplorer switching onto another 
buffers. I'm opening 2 buffers: the right panel is empty, the left panel: 
FileExplorer. I'm on the left. Type ":e /home/user". Then press "-" (go to up 
directory). Oops! FileExplorer switching me onto the right panel! :-( What is 
it?

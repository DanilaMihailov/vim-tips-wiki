==============================================================================

When editing LaTeX with Vim and previewing the pdf with a pdf viewer, you 
would like to be able to click on a word in the pdf viewer and have vim 
automatically jump to the location in the source file you clicked on. This is 
called backwards search, since clicking in the pdf viewer updates the vim 
location. To update the pdf viewer to a page containing the current location 
in Vim, see Open pdf to the current location in a LaTeX file 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Open_pdf_to_the_current_location_in_a_LaTeX_file].

LINUX                                                         *vtw-1468-linux*

TO DO There are some instructions here 
[http://jlebl.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/vim-evince-and-forward-and-backward-latex-synctex-search/], 
but they should be copied into this page.

WINDOWS                                                     *vtw-1468-windows*

TO DO Find how to do this on Windows.

MAC                                                             *vtw-1468-mac*

Mac OS has a package called pdfsync and a supporting viewer (I strongly 
recommend PDFView) can be configured to run a custom script when the user 
command-clicks inside the document.

To enable backwards search, install and configure the gvim-pdfsync 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1951] plugin.

PLUGINS                                                     *vtw-1468-plugins*
    - Automatic LaTeX plugin [http://atp-vim.sf.net] has forward and backward 
      search which works for quite a few viewers: xpdf (v3.03), evince, okular, 
      xdvi, open (on MacOs). Unfortunatelly, the plugin doesn't officially support 
      Windows. 
    - LaTeX Suite [http://vim-latex.sf.net] also support forward and reverse 
      searching.

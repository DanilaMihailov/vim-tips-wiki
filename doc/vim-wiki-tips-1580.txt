==============================================================================

Vim ships with its own Tutorial [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial], but 
the following should get you started if you're in a hurry:

At first:
    - Start typing something by pressing `i`. 
    - Exit Vim by pressing Esc then writing `:q` and pressing Enter 
    - Save your file similarly but using `:w myfile.txt` 


Getting help:
    - `:help :help` - how to use help 
    - `:help :helpgrep` - how to use the searchable help 
    - Learn to use the :help [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Learn_to_use_help]. Know 
      the difference between `:help foo`, :help 'foo and `:help c_foo`. 
    - Try Ctrl-D completion on help topics 
    - Refer to the Vimdoc |http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net| website for HTML versions 
      of the Vim docs and electronic copy of the Newriders Vimdoc 
      [http://www.truth.sk/vim/vimbook-OPL.pdf]. Also has lots of other howtos and 
      useful documents. 


Other tips:
    - If you find yourself trying to do some major text munging on a file, and 
      digging through the :help for esoteric regex tricks, consider using Perl if 
      you know it better. Otherwise, take a look at Category:Searching 
      [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Searching] and Category:Advanced_Regex 
      [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Advanced_Regex]. 
    - Start with VimTutor or the IRC Style Tutorial 
      [http://vi-improved.org/tutorial.php] on the #vim IRC channel site. 
    - Don't worry about trying to know everything about Vim, just learn features 
      that are useful for what you are currently doing – as time goes on, your 
      personal featureset will grow. 
    - Use :make and :grep [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Find_in_files_within_Vim] 
      instead of :!make or :!grep. Then use :cwin or :copen to view the results of 
      either make or grep in a coloured list. You can jump to the corresponding 
      line/file with either Return or when click on it, if 'mouse' is set to a (:set 
      mouse=a). 
    - touch $HOME/.vimrc 
    - Read Quick tips [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Quick_tips]. 
    - Find and read lots of example vimrc files. You can find a few on the 
      VimRcExamples page. 
    - Learn how to use visual and blockwise-visual modes. Type :help visual-use to 
      get started. 
    - Learn how to avoid using the arrow keys. I cut out a piece of cardboard and 
      put them over my arrow keys to force myself to learn how to navigate using the 
      keys on the home row almost exclusively. Once you learn how efficient vi 
      keybindings can be, you'll never want to go back. 
    - Learn how to use Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N to tell Vim to complete the word you are 
      currently typing. This saves me a LOT of time when I am coding.

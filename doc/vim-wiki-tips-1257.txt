==============================================================================

In insert mode, type the first couple of characters of a word, then press:
    - Ctrl-N to insert the next matching word; or
    - Ctrl-P to insert the previous matching word.


This is particularly useful when entering the names of variables in a 
program.

The 'complete' option controls where the keywords are searched (include 
files, tag files, buffers, and more).

The 'completeopt' option controls how the completion occurs (for example, 
whether a menu is shown).

==============================================================================

Completion such as this is also why it is a good idea to have descriptive 
variable names, so you can easily tell if you have the completion you were 
after.

==============================================================================

It's completion that made me unable to use Visual Studio's editor (which has 
some completion, but it's not as good) anymore. I get lots of use out of:
    - File completion: <C-X><C-F>
    - Line completion: <C-X><C-L>
    - Omni completion: <C-X><C-O>


==============================================================================

If you have several words you would like to complete, you can use Ctrl-X 
Ctrl-P to extend the match. For example, suppose a line exists in your file:

>
    $res = mysql_query($q) or die(mysql_error());
<

You want to type the line:

>
    $result = mysql_query($q) or die(mysql_error());
<

Type:

>
    $result = my
<

Keep pressing Ctrl-P until you get to mysql_query.

Then pressing Ctrl-X Ctrl-P will give:

>
    $result = mysql_query($q
<

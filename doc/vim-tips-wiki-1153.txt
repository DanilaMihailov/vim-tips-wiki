==============================================================================

Some commands do not accept ranges, but you want to execute them for every 
line in the range.

This trick allows to apply the range to any command that does not accept 
range directly:

>
    :n1,n2 g/^/ command
<

That is, you add `g/^/` between the range and the command.

==============================================================================

When Vim is called from `crontab -e` it will not work if the '`backup`' 
option is set to no or auto. (I get the error message

crontab: temp file must be edited in place

when exiting Vim.) There is some information at :help |crontab| but it does 
not suggest how to fix the problem. So far, adding this to my vimrc file seems 
to work:

>
    au BufEnter /private/tmp/crontab.* setl backupcopy=yes
<

The temporary file created by crontab on Mac OS X is named something like 
`/private/tmp/crontab.XXXXXXXXXX` (with a random string of characters at the 
end). On other systems, you may need to use a different pattern.

Another option that can be set in vimrc tip from ( 
http://tim.theenchanter.com/2008_07_01_archive.html 
[http://tim.theenchanter.com/2008_07_01_archive.html] ) is

>
    set backupskip=/tmp/*,/private/tmp/*
<

You can also create a file ~/.vim/ftplugin/crontab.vim with the following 
content:

>
    set backupcopy=yes
<

And another option is to add this to ~/.vimrc:

>
    autocmd FileType crontab setlocal nobackup nowritebackup
<

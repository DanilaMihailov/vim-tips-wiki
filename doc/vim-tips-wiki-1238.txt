==============================================================================

If a file on disk is read-only, I would prefer that Vim prevent me from 
modifying it, rather than giving an error message when I try to write out my 
changes. The modifiable option does exactly this - when off, it prevents 
changes from being made to the buffer. However, the modifiable option is on by 
default. Thus I use the following function to keep a buffer's modifiable state 
in sync with the underlying file's readonly state. It works especially well 
when the autoread option is enabled.

    function UpdateModifiable()
      if !exists("b:setmodifiable")
        let b:setmodifiable = 0
      endif
      if &readonly
        if &modifiable
          setlocal nomodifiable
          let b:setmodifiable = 1
        endif
      else
        if b:setmodifiable
          setlocal modifiable
        endif
      endif
    endfunction
    autocmd BufReadPost * call UpdateModifiable()

Why is the `b:setmodifiable` variable needed?

Did you mean:

>
    autocmd BufReadPost * if &readonly | setlocal nomodifiable | else | setlocal modifiable | endif
<

I think b:setmodifiable is there to set &modifiable only if the &readonly 
previously triggered the script to set &nomodifiable . So, it will skip files 
that are &nomodifiable but not &readonly. Is that correct? I don't think that 
case happens much.

==============================================================================

You are right about b:setmodifiable. It is to prevent setting &modifiable 
when reloading a file that is not &readonly, but which had &nomodifiable set 
manually. It may be overkill, but it still works correctly.

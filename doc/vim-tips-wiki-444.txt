==============================================================================

Put this in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] if you use the 
cwindow:

>
    " \cc
    map <Leader>cc :cwindow<CR>:cc<CR><c-w>bz<CR><CR>
    " \cn
    map <Leader>cn :cwindow<CR>:cn<CR><c-w>bz<CR><CR>
    " \cp
    map <Leader>cp :cwindow<CR>:cp<CR><c-w>bz<CR><CR>
<

and when you use `\cc` (or whatever your leader character is + cc), `\cn` or 
`\cp`, it will do what :cc, :cn and :cp usually did, with the added bonus of 
showing the entire contents of multiline errors. this is especially useful for 
javac via ant, and it's obnoxious to keep typing <c-w>b<CR> every time i do a 
:cn, so i mapped this.

Detailed explanation:
    - ":cwindow<CR>" ensures that the quickfix window is shown. 

    - ":cc" (:cn, and :cp) actually do the operation 

    - "<c-w>b" go to the bottom window (which cwindow will be if it's shown) which 
      will magically center on the error 

    - "z<CR>" will reposition the buffer in the window so that the current line 
      becomes the top line in the window 

    - "<CR>" carriage-return on the error line, taking you back to the code with 
      the error

Another solution to this problem is to "set cmdheight=2" which will provide 
two lines at the bottom of the screen for quickfix error lines instead of the 
default one.

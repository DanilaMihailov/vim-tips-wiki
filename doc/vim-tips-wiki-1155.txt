==============================================================================

This function/command works just like the built-in `:set` except that it 
escapes out the spaces on the rhs, making things a bit more easy:

Regular set:

>
    set fp=par\ 70j
<

Our set:

>
    Set fp=par 70j
<

Just like the regular `:set`, multiple options may still be specified:

>
    Set fp=par 70j tw=100 ai! ai?
<

The only known caveat is in single word options:

>
    Set fp=par 70j ai
<

What you'll end up with is 'fp' set to 'par 70j ai' because Set uses the 
presence of the =, ! or ? symbols to differentiate the current word as the 
start of a new option rather than part of the last one.

Of course, there is no real reason to use Set unless there is an obscure set, 
such as:

>
    Set mp=texify -b -p --src-specials %
<

vs

>
    set mp=texify\ -b\ -p\ --src-specials\ %
<

Of course, there is:

>
    let &mp='texify -b -p --src-specials %'
<

I like the ability to use Set, however; requires much less thought and 
planning: if I do a regular 'set' and get an error, I just go up a line in the 
command-line history and change the 'set' to 'Set' and forget it.

    function! Set( ... )
      let result = ''
      for i in a:000
        if ( i !~ '[=!?]' )
          let result .= '\'
        endif
        " Escaping out any existing spaces takes care of the case where we passed in escaped spaces.
        let result .= ' ' .escape( i, ' ' )
      endfor
      execute 'set' .result
    endfunction
    com! -nargs=+ -complete=option Set call Set( <f-args> )

If I'm reading that right, it can't correctly preseve multiple spaces on the 
original line. That may sometimes be a problem. Multiple consecutive spaces, I 
mean.

==============================================================================

You are correct. I had toyed with the idea of passing everything in as one 
big argument and parsing through it myself (match() and strpart() or 
something), but I just couldn't think of an example from my personal usage 
where I ever passed in anything but single spaces.

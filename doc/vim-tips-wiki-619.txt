This tip explains how to make a keymap for yourself. It is based on:
    - :help |mbyte-keymap| 
    - :help |keymap-file-format| 


You'll also find relevant information at:
    - :help 'keymap' 
    - :help 'iminsert' 
    - :help |language-mapping| 
    - :help <Char> |&lt;Char&gt;| 


HOW TO NAME THE FILE AND WHERE TO PLACE IT *vtw-619-how-to-name-the-file-and-where-to-place-it*

Keymaps reside in the "keymap" subdirectory of the directories named in 
'runtimepath'. Their names are of one of the forms:

>
    <keymap>.vim
    <keymap>_<encoding>.vim
<

so if you need keymaps for Czech and Norwegian, and want to use them under 
UTF-8, you will probably create two keymaps, named, for instance, 
"czech_utf8.vim" and "norwegian_utf8.vim". If those names collide with names 
already present in $VIMRUNTIME/keymap/, then either use slightly different 
names before the underline, or put them in the "keymap" subdirectory of a 
directory named earlier than $VIMRUNTIME in 'runtimepath', so yours will be 
found first (but in the latter case you won't be able to use the default 
keymap of the same name). Create the needed directory if it doesn't exist yet.

WHAT A KEYMAP CONSISTS OF                  *vtw-619-what-a-keymap-consists-of*

A keymap consists of three parts:

FIRST PART OF A KEYMAP: THE VIM SCRIPT *vtw-619-first-part-of-a-keymap:-the-vim-script*

This may contain any Ex-commands and Vim comments germane to the use of the 
keymap. In particular, the following Ex-commands are useful:

(1) If this keymap is only a slight modification of another, preexisting one: 
a "source" statement for the keymap on which this one is based. Then you will 
only have to code the changes.

(2) A short name, for instance in a keymap for Czech

>
    let b:keymap_name="cz"
<

This will appear as <cz> near the right end of the standard status line for 
any window where the keymap in question is enabled (by having its long name 
set ot setlocal'ed in 'keymap' and 'iminsert' setlocal'ed to 1).

(3) A cursor color for when keymaps are in use. This one is more 
controversial (Bram comments it out in published keymaps) but I find it useful 
in my "private" ones.

>
    highlight lCursor ctermbg=red guibg=red
<

Use any color that pleases you, and beware that highlight groups are global 
for the whole of Vim, so it is possible to use different keymaps in split 
windows of a single Vim instance, but not different language cursor colors, 
unless you set up an autocommand to change the lCursor highlight at the 
WinEnter event. (How to make that work is outside the scope of this HowTo.)

SECOND PART: THE LOADKEYMAP |:LOADKEYMAP| COMMAND *vtw-619-second-part:-the-loadkeymap-|:loadkeymap|-command*

This is just to tell Vim that whatever comes after, to the end of the file, 
is a series of language-mappings, in a special format which will be described 
hereafter.

THIRD PART: THE MAPPINGS THEMSELVES *vtw-619-third-part:-the-mappings-themselves*

Each key mapping line consists of three parts; the optional third one may 
contain spaces but not the first two:

>
    {lhs} {rhs} [comment]
<

Vim interprets this line as if (in a standard Vim script) there had been

>
    lmap <buffer> {lhs} {rhs}
<

The {lhs} is what you press, as interpreted by your default (English) 
keyboard. It is usually a single character, but it may be more than one: in 
that case all of them but the last act as "dead keys". For instance, in a 
German keymap, you may want to use the colon as a prefix to tell that the 
following vowel gets an umlaut (so that :A maps to Ä, :a to ä etc.)

Any key or key combination which does not appear as an {lhs} keeps its 
"English" meaning in the target language. (This will usually be the case for 
the space bar and for any punctuation, or even letters, that you don't want to 
move about on the keyboard.) This means that if, for instance, you map the sz 
letter pair to the German eszet, you'll still be able to use the small-s 
letter with its usual meaning whenever it is not followed by z. Similarly, if 
you map the colon as above, a colon remains a colon if followed by anything 
other than a vowel, for instance a space or a digit.

In all cases, you can force the initial key(s) of a mapping to keep their 
original meaning, either by waiting for the mapping to time out, or by moving 
the cursor about, for instance with <Left><Right>.

The {rhs} is what it translates to, in the target language. For UTF-8 the 
{rhs} may be of the form <Char-0> to <Char-2347483647> (decimal), or 
<Char-0x0> to <Char-0x7FFFFFFF> (hex), or <Char-00> to <Char-017777777777> 
(octal) -- see :help |<Char>|. For other encoding targets, the <Char> notation 
may also be used, but of course only as far as the target permits: e.g. in 
8-bit encodings, only till 255 / 0xFF / 0377.

The [comment] is the easiest: it's for the human reader of the keymap, not 
for Vim.

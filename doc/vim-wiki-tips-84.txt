==============================================================================

One of the things i do a lot in Vim is to make a change to the beginning or 
end of the line (such as adding the text '// remove' at the end of java debug 
code). a quick way of doing this is to use a to append the text to the end of 
the first line and then move down one, hit . (repeat last edit), move down, 
hit . etc. etc. the following mapping allows one to simply highlight the 
region in question and hit . -- it will automatically execute the . once on 
each line:

>
    " allow the . to execute once for each line of a visual selection
    vnoremap . :normal .<CR>
<

Another thing i do a lot is to record a quick macro in the "a" register and 
then play it back a number of times. while @@ can be used to repeat the last 
register used, my recorded macros sometimes use other registers so @@ doesn't 
necessarily give me the same results as @a. also, i have mapped ' to ` because 
i like to go to the precise location of my marks -- always -- and never to the 
beginning of the line. this leaves my ` key unused. so:

>
    " make ` execute the contents of the a register
    nnoremap ` @a
<

then, in keeping with the visual . above, i did the same for the ` -- is 
thexecutes @a once on each highlighed line.

>
    vnoremap ` :normal @a<CR>
<

as an example, say i have the following lines of java code:

>
    public String m_asdf;
    public String m_lkhj;
    public int m_hjkhjkh;
<

and, for some reason, i need to get the following:

>
    "asdf"
     "lkhj"
     "hjkhjkh"
<

I record the following into a:

>
    ^cf_"<Esc>$r"
<

the ^ is because my java code is indented and i don't want to go to column 0 
and the <Esc> is an actual escape i hit to exit insert mode. then, i simply 
select (visually) the other lines (only two in case -- admittedly not an 
overly useful example) and just hit `.

COMMENTS  *vwt-84-comments*

i found that a few plugin scripts that i use regularly depended on ` having 
default functionality, so i switched the ` key to ~ for my use (i couldn't be 
bothered to change all the scripts to use noremap instead of just map).

==============================================================================

as a side note, i have the following mapping in my vimrc:

>
    noremap v ~
<

since i find the v easier to hit than the tilde anyway -- and i don't have 
any plugins that fiddle about with the case of my text so i don't break 
anything this way.

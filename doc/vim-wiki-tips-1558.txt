==============================================================================

The following function can be used to maintain a list of handlers, to make 
handling a keypress in different contexts more dynamic.

>
    function! RunHandlers(handler_list, default_action)
      for handler in a:handler_list
        execute "let handled = " handler."()"
        if handled
          return
        endif
      endfor
      execute a:default_action
    endfunction
<

This function calls a list of handlers until one returns true, indicating the 
event was handled. If no handler returns true, a default action is executed.

Take for example, the following `CloseScratch` function.

>
    function! CloseScratch()
      if &buftype == "nofile" && &bufhidden == "hide" && !&swapfile
        bdelete
        return 1
      endif
      return 0
    endfunction
<

Using `RunHandlers` I can now dynamically overload <Esc> to call this 
function (in normal mode), like so:

>
    " Default Escape and clear message line.
    function! DefaultEsc()
      normal! "<Esc>"
      echo ""
    endfunction
    
    let g:esc_handler = []
    call add(g:esc_handler, "CloseScratch")
    nnoremap <Esc> :call RunHandlers(g:esc_handler, "call DefaultEsc()")<CR>
<

Adding more handlers should be easy enough. In this case, `CloseScratch` is 
tried first, and if that fails `DefaultEsc` is called.

Try using :silent or <silent> rather than an empty echo to make the bottom 
line clear.
    - :help |:silent| 
    - :help |:map-silent| 


This is a pretty cool tip though! I like the idea of multiple things mapped 
to the same key.

I think the idea of echo "" is to clear the message line, for example, if you previously got a "Pattern not found" message.
I think you're right about the purpose, but I personally think it is better to avoid the message in the first place with :silent! or the 'e' option for searches. But I guess I'm just nitpicking.
Here is the idea: I search for 'fangle'. Oops, not found. So now there is a "Pattern not found" message on my screen. Some people (I am one of them) can't concentrate while prominent messages are displayed, so I have mapped Space to ':nohl' and ':echo ""'. I once tried to convince Bram that Esc should default to do exactly that because I've seen other people use Vim and go crazy while trying to remove no-longer wanted search highlights and messages. No one on vim_use could understand my POV.

==============================================================================

Will someone please explain what DefaultEsc actually does!? I can understand 
the echo, and I know that normal! "<Esc>" will execute the normal command 
"press the Escape key" (without invoking any mapping for that key). But what 
does the Escape key do in normal mode (apart from beep/flash if you had them 
turned on)??

for example it cancels any typed v:count or v:register

I have improved the script, and I can see that it is potentially useful, but 
I think the tip is pretty disappointing without a realistic example of 
chaining a couple of handlers. --JohnBeckett

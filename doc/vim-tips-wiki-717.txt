==============================================================================

Even thought I can press "`c`" to switch directory if I want to execute a 
command in the directory that I am viewing with the explorer.vim plugin, but 
sometimes I don't want to actually change to that directory to execute it 
because I want to remain in whatever directory I am in such as a root 
directory of source files. So I opened up explorer.vim to see if I can add it 
directly to the plugin, but I found out that it can call a variable 
`g:explFileHandler` that stores the user defined function whenever the key 
'`x`' is pressed on a file or directory. So I used that to implement executing 
a command in the viewing directory in my vimrc as follows:

>
    function! MyFileHandler(filename)
      let oldpath = getcwd()
      let currentdirectory = ""
      if(isdirectory(a:filename))
        let currentdirectory = strpart(a:filename, 0, strlen(a:filename) - 1)
      else
        let currentdirectory = a:filename
      endif
      let lastslash = strridx(currentdirectory, "/")
      let currentdirectory = strpart(currentdirectory, 0, lastslash)
      let usercommand = input(currentdirectory . "# ")
      if(strlen(usercommand) > 0)
        execute "cd " . currentdirectory
        execute "!" . usercommand
        execute "cd " . oldpath
      endif
    endfunction
    "
    let g:explFileHandler = "MyFileHandler"
<

It will prompt the user with the directory mimicking a shell prompt where the 
user can enter the command.

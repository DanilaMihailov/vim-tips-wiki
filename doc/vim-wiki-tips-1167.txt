From the Vim FAQ:

    10.2. In insert mode, when I press the <Esc> key to go to command mode, the
     cursor moves one character to the left (except when the cursor is on
     the first character of the line). Is it possible to change this
     behavior to keep the cursor at the same column?
    
    No. It is not possible to change this behavior. The cursor is *always*
    positioned on a valid character (unless you have virtual-edit mode
    enabled). So, if you are appending text to the end of a line, when you
    return to command mode the cursor *must* drop back onto the last character
    you typed. For consistency sake, the cursor drops back everywhere, even if
    you are in the middle of a line.
    
    You can use the CTRL-O command in insert mode to execute a single ex
    command and return back to insert mode without moving the cursor column.
<

If you don't care about consistency and only want the cursor to drop back 
when necessary when exiting insert mode, try:

>
    inoremap <silent> <Esc> <C-O>:stopinsert<CR>
<

If the cursor is not on a valid character (for example, at the end of a 
line), it will still be moved back one character (unless virtual-edit mode is 
enabled).

If you are in paste mode and hit <Esc>, the cursor will still be moved back 
one character (since all mappings are ignored in paste mode).

But, otherwise, when using this mapping, <Esc> generally won't move the 
cursor.

If you have any other mappings which begin with <Esc> (for example, 'map 
<S-Up> ...' doesn't seem to work right for me, so I use 'map ^[[1;2A ...', 
which starts with <Esc>), then 'timeoutlen' will apply to this mapping, and 
the cursor will move one character to the left until 'timeoutlen' expires, 
then will move back to the proper position.

Mapping the <esc> key leads to problems most of the time. Here's how to do it 
programmatically:

>
    let CursorColumnI = 0 "the cursor column position in INSERT
    autocmd InsertEnter * let CursorColumnI = col('.')
    autocmd CursorMovedI * let CursorColumnI = col('.')
    autocmd InsertLeave * if col('.') != CursorColumnI | call cursor(0, col('.')+1) | endif
<

Putting the above in your vimrc keeps track of the cursor position when in 
INSERT mode. When exiting INSERT mode, it will move the cursor ahead one 
column if the cursor position has changed after leaving insert.

The way it's suggested in the tip, it breaks the immensely useful 
Visual-block Insert mode (:h v_b_i). This seems to not break anything (except 
when used in console Vim over ssh -- then any <Esc> remapping breaks escape 
sequences for some reason):

>
    inoremap <silent> <Esc> <Esc>`^

hmmm... interesting... when I remove all my mappings beginning with an <Esc> 
character, this little trick causes all sorts of problems.It only seems to 
work properly when there is some mapping beginning with an <Esc> 
character.Very strange behavior.

Perhaps that's why the Karma on this tip is horrible?

==============================================================================

If you are on a terminal, a quick and dirty way is to type Alt+L to switch to 
normal mode.

==============================================================================

I don't think it's fair to say that if you want this behavior, then "you 
don't care about consistency". The default behavior is also "inconsistent" 
when you are at the beginning of a line; those two behaviors are totally 
symmetric in that sense.

EXIT INSERT MODE WITHOUT MOVING CURSOR -- THIS WORKS: *vwt-1167-exit-insert-mode-without-moving-cursor----this-works:*

The solutions above (and those found on similar pages) do not work on my 
terminal (Yakuake). Specifically, mapping Esc to <Esc>`^ causes strange 
behaviour (insertion of line breaks and 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' characters) with 
arrow keys, and the del key. And while one may argue we are not to touch these 
keys in vim, for me, I'd rather something not go wrong if I do once in a 
while.

My advice is don't remap Esc to anything else within vim. I have swapped my 
CapsLock with Esc globally (if you have KDE desktop, it's one checkbox in 
'system settings' > 'input devices' > 'advanced keyboard settings'). This 
works just fine in vim. But if I were to then map the Esc command to something 
else, it will cause side effects. This will be the case regardless of your 
global key mapping. Many commands in vim rely on Esc and once you remap it to 
anything else you will have side effects. In other words make sure <Esc> is 
not in the left hand side of any of your custom key mappings (just my advice 
to keep it simple, although I'm sure there is an overly-complex work around).

Thankfully, a small change to some of the ideas here does work nicely and 
provides a clean and fast way of exiting insert mode without moving the 
cursor. Namely, I've left the Escape command alone, so it still works as 
before -- as do the various ways of entering insert mode. Choose a short fast 
sequence you like. I chose 'fj' and its typo partner 'jf', either of which 
when typed quickly will exit insert mode and preserve the cursor position 
(unless at the end of a line and not on a valid character). If you need to 
type "fjord", you have to wait the timeout length, which by default is 1 
second (timeoutlen=1000) after pressing 'f', before pressing 'j'. I recommend 
shortening this to about 300 (3/10ths of a second), so you won't notice the 
wait when necessary (see below).

Notes: Ctrl-c is the same as pressing Esc when in insert mode. inoremap is 
non-recursive key mapping for insert mode. Simply adding one 'l' after the Esc 
command, moves cursor one right. Pressing <A-l> in insert mode works fine but 
is slow to type. Mapping to it causes side effects. And <C-o> is problematic. 
Finally, don't add in-line comments when remapping.

Add the following to your .vimrc and restart your terminal:

>
    " Exit INSERT mode without moving cursor (press fj or jf)
<

>
    set timeoutlen=300
    inoremap fj <Esc>l
    inoremap jf <Esc>l
<

This works the same:

>
    " Exit INSERT mode without moving cursor (press fj or jf)
<

>
    set timeoutlen=300
    inoremap fj <C-c>l
    inoremap jf <C-c>l
<

Now you can exit Insert mode with ease without moving the cursor! Happy 
coding! --September 18, 2014

The problem with <Esc>l is that it fails when you're at the beginning of the line. The autocmds above work in all cases. --September 28, 2014

To get consistent behavior at the end and the beginning of the line, one can 
insert a symbol (e.g., 'x') and then delete it in a 'black hole' register:

>
    set timeoutlen=300
    inoremap fj x<C-c>"_x
<

<C-C> isn't the same as <Esc>. See :help |i_CTRL-C|. When leaving insert mode 
this way, no abbreviations or autocmds are triggered! --Fritzophrenic

==============================================================================

This is a sample vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] created in 
discussion with the ops and regulars of the #vim community 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_on_Freenode]. When starting to use Vim, 
either this sample or another "minimal" vimrc should be copied as a 
starting-point to create a vimrc. Also see the example distributed with Vim 
[https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/vimrc_example.vim] and use 
:help |vimrc_example.vim|. Note that Vim 8.0 also introduced the defaults.vim 
[https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/defaults.vim] file, which 
loads some nicer options when no vimrc is found. There are also plugins like 
sensible.vim [https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible] that try to provide a set 
of defaults that "everyone can agree on". In addition, some distributions 
provide their own defaults; for instance, Debian-based distros load 
debian.vim.

REQUIREMENTS                                           *vwt-1628-requirements*

The code in this example `.vimrc` requires a full featured Vim. While it is 
possible to insert checks to omit some settings for Vim binaries with fewer 
features, that would make the file more complex and hard to understand.

If your Vim does not support some of the options and features suggested here, 
you will have to install a Vim package with a larger feature set, or upgrade 
to a newer version [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Download] of Vim.

EXAMPLE VIMRC                                         *vwt-1628-example-vimrc*

This is a minimal but feature rich vimrc intended for new and intermediate 
Vim users. It is important to understand the options and features mentioned 
here in order that Vim is used efficiently.

    " Description: A minimal, but feature rich, example .vimrc. If you are a
    "              newbie, basing your first .vimrc on this file is a good choice.
    "              If you're a more advanced user, building your own .vimrc based
    "              on this file is still a good idea.
     
    "------------------------------------------------------------
    " Features {{{1
    "
    " These options and commands enable some very useful features in Vim, that
    " no user should have to live without.
     
    " Set 'nocompatible' to ward off unexpected things that your distro might
    " have made, as well as sanely reset options when re-sourcing .vimrc
    set nocompatible
     
    " Attempt to determine the type of a file based on its name and possibly its
    " contents. Use this to allow intelligent auto-indenting for each filetype,
    " and for plugins that are filetype specific.
    filetype indent plugin on
     
    " Enable syntax highlighting
    syntax on
     
     
    "------------------------------------------------------------
    " Must have options {{{1
    "
    " These are highly recommended options.
     
    " Vim with default settings does not allow easy switching between multiple files
    " in the same editor window. Users can use multiple split windows or multiple
    " tab pages to edit multiple files, but it is still best to enable an option to
    " allow easier switching between files.
    "
    " One such option is the 'hidden' option, which allows you to re-use the same
    " window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first. Also allows
    " you to keep an undo history for multiple files when re-using the same window
    " in this way. Note that using persistent undo also lets you undo in multiple
    " files even in the same window, but is less efficient and is actually designed
    " for keeping undo history after closing Vim entirely. Vim will complain if you
    " try to quit without saving, and swap files will keep you safe if your computer
    " crashes.
    set hidden
     
    " Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden option).
    " Alternatives include using tabs or split windows instead of re-using the same
    " window as mentioned above, and/or either of the following options:
    " set confirm
    " set autowriteall
     
    " Better command-line completion
    set wildmenu
     
    " Show partial commands in the last line of the screen
    set showcmd
     
    " Highlight searches (use <C-L> to temporarily turn off highlighting; see the
    " mapping of <C-L> below)
    set hlsearch
     
    " Modelines have historically been a source of security vulnerabilities. As
    " such, it may be a good idea to disable them and use the securemodelines
    " script, <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1876>.
    " set nomodeline
     
     
    "------------------------------------------------------------
    " Usability options {{{1
    "
    " These are options that users frequently set in their .vimrc. Some of them
    " change Vim's behaviour in ways which deviate from the true Vi way, but
    " which are considered to add usability. Which, if any, of these options to
    " use is very much a personal preference, but they are harmless.
     
    " Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters
    set ignorecase
    set smartcase
     
    " Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action
    set backspace=indent,eol,start
     
    " When opening a new line and no filetype-specific indenting is enabled, keep
    " the same indent as the line you're currently on. Useful for READMEs, etc.
    set autoindent
     
    " Stop certain movements from always going to the first character of a line.
    " While this behaviour deviates from that of Vi, it does what most users
    " coming from other editors would expect.
    set nostartofline
     
    " Display the cursor position on the last line of the screen or in the status
    " line of a window
    set ruler
     
    " Always display the status line, even if only one window is displayed
    set laststatus=2
     
    " Instead of failing a command because of unsaved changes, instead raise a
    " dialogue asking if you wish to save changed files.
    set confirm
     
    " Use visual bell instead of beeping when doing something wrong
    set visualbell
     
    " And reset the terminal code for the visual bell. If visualbell is set, and
    " this line is also included, vim will neither flash nor beep. If visualbell
    " is unset, this does nothing.
    set t_vb=
     
    " Enable use of the mouse for all modes
    set mouse=a
     
    " Set the command window height to 2 lines, to avoid many cases of having to
    " "press <Enter> to continue"
    set cmdheight=2
     
    " Display line numbers on the left
    set number
     
    " Quickly time out on keycodes, but never time out on mappings
    set notimeout ttimeout ttimeoutlen=200
     
    " Use <F11> to toggle between 'paste' and 'nopaste'
    set pastetoggle=<F11>
     
     
    "------------------------------------------------------------
    " Indentation options {{{1
    "
    " Indentation settings according to personal preference.
     
    " Indentation settings for using 4 spaces instead of tabs.
    " Do not change 'tabstop' from its default value of 8 with this setup.
    set shiftwidth=4
    set softtabstop=4
    set expandtab
     
    " Indentation settings for using hard tabs for indent. Display tabs as
    " four characters wide.
    "set shiftwidth=4
    "set tabstop=4
     
     
    "------------------------------------------------------------
    " Mappings {{{1
    "
    " Useful mappings
     
    " Map Y to act like D and C, i.e. to yank until EOL, rather than act as yy,
    " which is the default
    map Y y$
     
    " Map <C-L> (redraw screen) to also turn off search highlighting until the
    " next search
    nnoremap <C-L> :nohl<CR><C-L>
     
    "------------------------------------------------------------

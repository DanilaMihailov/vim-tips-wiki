TIP 307 HAS BEEN REMOVED                    *vwt-307-tip-307-has-been-removed*

It is hard to find helpful information if there are too many tips.

Therefore, we are removing some tips that refer to obsolete versions, or 
which have been superseded, or which are no longer useful.

The original tip was at vim.org which may be in this archive Tip#307 
[http://web.archive.org/web/www.vim.org/tips/tip.php?tip_id=307].

Article was a question not a tip (answer in VimTip1549 |vwt-1549|).

==============================================================================

This is relevant when your 'formatoptions' includes o.

From :help |fo-table|, "Automatically insert the current comment leader after 
hitting 'o' or 'O' in Normal mode."

I like this behavior enough to keep the o option, however at times I want to 
not insert the comment chars, and although manually deleting the added chars 
is not hard I present these simple mappings that delete the added chars 
automatically.

>
    nnoremap go o<Esc>S
    nnoremap gO O<Esc>S
<

This makes go open a new line under the cursor and removes inserted chars, 
while gO opens a new line above the cursor and removes inserted chars.

COMMENTS  *vwt-350-comments*

It should be noted that the go mapping presented above will interfere with 
Vim's default go (Go to {count} byte in the buffer :help |go|) command.

There should be a much more elegant way of achieving the same effect, but I 
am currently unaware of what it might be.

==============================================================================

I look everywhere for a solution to this problem. My work around is to use 
Ctrl-W (insert mode) to delete the previous word.

A side note. I find it useful to use Ctrl-Backspace instead of Ctrl-W.

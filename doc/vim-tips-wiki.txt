1500+ tips downloaded from Vim Tips Wiki

work like native Vim help files. 

You can use |:helpgrep| to search tips, <C-]> to jump tags and |gO| (thats
capital o) to see table of contents. All tips are numbered and tagged in a
format `vtw-N` where `N` is number of a tip. 

Try 
>
    :help vtw-1

You can get random tip by executing *:RandomVimTip* command.

WHY THOUGH						   *vim-tips-wiki-why*

Sometimes I find myself using |:helpgrep| and not finding what I am looking
for, often because I did not use correct word or phrase. I hope that having
1500+ tips written by users will help solve this problem.

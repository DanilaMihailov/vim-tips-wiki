==============================================================================

To count the number of matches of a pattern, use the substitute command 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace] with the `n` flag. The 
following shows the number of times that `pattern` matches text in the current 
buffer:

>
    :%s/pattern//gn
<

Omit `g` to display the number of lines where the pattern matches:

>
    :%s/pattern//n
<

To restrict the count to a region of the text, specify a range instead of `%` 
(`%` means all lines). For example, the following counts the number of 
occurrences in lines 10 to 50 inclusive:

>
    :10,50s/pattern//gn
<

The following counts the number of occurrences in the lines in the most 
recent visual selection [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Visual_selection].

>
    :'<,'>s/pattern//gn
<

WORD UNDER CURSOR                                  *vtw-860-word-under-cursor*

To count the number of occurrences of the last used search pattern, you can 
leave out the pattern entirely:

>
    :%s///gn
<

This makes it easy to count the number of occurrences of the word under the 
cursor: first press `*` to search for the current word 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Searching], then enter `:%s///gn` to count all 
occurrences of that word.

To access this quickly, define a shortcut command like

>
    map ,* *<C-O>:%s///gn<CR>
<

then typing `,*` in quick succession will run the following: `*` finds the 
next match to the word under the cursor, <C-O> (CTRL+O) returns the cursor to 
where it started, then `:%s///gn` does the counting we want. Of course this 
also works with any choice of command instead of `,*`, and you can even 
overwrite the meaning of `*` with nnoremap * *<C-O>:%s///gn<CR> (see `:help 
map`)

This thing is causing "Trailing characters" error in gvi editor....what might 
be the problem?

Which thing? One problem could be that "gvi" is not necessarily the same as "gvim" and may not actually be Vim, but something else, or a very stripped-down version. But I'm only speculating here without version information about "gvi" and without knowing which specific command gives that error. --Fritzophrenic (talk) 17:05, October 25, 2016 (UTC)

Just to add one thing here, after running suggested command, cursor actually 
moves to first non space character in the line where search started, not at 
the beginning of searched pattern. For that add 'n' at the end to move cursor 
to beginning of the word, like nnoremap * *<C-O>:%s///gn<CR>n..-@Rakesh

Add ```` at the end to move cursor back to the beginning of word, which keeps 
the count status line.

Like: map ,* *<C-O>:%s///gn<CR>``

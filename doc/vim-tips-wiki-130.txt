==============================================================================

A file type plugin (ftplugin) is a script that is run automatically when Vim 
detects the type of file when the file is created or opened. The type can be 
detected from the file name (for example, file `sample.c` has file type `c`), 
or from the file contents.

OVERVIEW                                                    *vtw-130-overview*

For an overview of file type plugins see :help |ftplugins|.

DISABLING DEFAULT FTPLUGINS              *vtw-130-disabling-default-ftplugins*

If you want to disable all ftplugins, or disable a particular default 
ftplugin, see :help |:filetype| and :help |ftplugin-overrule|.

If you have your own ftplugins, and you want to disable all the default ones, 
then do not include a check for `b:did_ftplugin` in your ftplugin files, and 
add the line

>
    :autocmd BufReadPre,BufNewFile * let b:did_ftplugin = 1
<

to your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc], before the `:filetype 
plugin on` line.

SETTING A DEFAULT FILETYPE                *vtw-130-setting-a-default-filetype*

When you edit a blank buffer (for example, just after starting Vim, or as a 
result of the `:new` command), the buffer will have no filetype so there will 
be no syntax highlighting or other ftplugin assistance.

You can check the filetype of the current buffer with command:

>
    :set ft?
<

You can set the filetype of the current buffer with a command like this 
example:

>
    :set ft=python
<

Another approach is to assign a file name when creating the blank buffer, for 
example, by entering a command like `vim mynewfile.py` to start Vim, or with 
commands like these from within Vim:

>
    :new mynewfile.py
    :edit mynewfile.py
    :tabnew mynewfile.py
<

Alternatively, the following in your vimrc 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] will set a default filetype for all new 
buffers:

>
    " default filetype
    let g:do_filetype = 0
    au BufWinEnter,BufAdd * if expand('<afile>') == "" | let g:do_filetype = 1 | endif
    au BufEnter * if g:do_filetype | setf python | let g:do_filetype = 0 | endif
<

`BufWinEnter` is for the buffer that is opened on startup. `BufAdd` is for 
new blank buffers.

Why the need to use a global variable, and not set the `filetype` 
immediately, is to my understanding, because the buffer hasn't been fully 
created when the autocmd is triggered.

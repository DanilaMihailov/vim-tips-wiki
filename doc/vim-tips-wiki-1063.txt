==============================================================================

After searching for text, you can use `:g//` to list all lines containing the 
pattern you last searched for. Or, just type `g/pattern/` to display all lines 
containing pattern. This tip shows how to capture the result (the list of all 
lines that contain the pattern).

USER COMMAND                                           *vtw-1063-user-command*

The following addition for your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc] 
defines the `:Filter` command:

>
    command! -nargs=? Filter let @a='' | execute 'g/<args>/y A' | new | setlocal bt=nofile | put! a
<

After searching for some text, enter `:Filter` (or just type `:F` then press 
Tab for command completion). Entering this command will open a new scratch 
window listing all lines that contain the text that was last searched for.

You can also type the search pattern on the command line. For example, 
`:Filter red\|blue` lists all lines that contain "red" or "blue".

The command accepts zero or one argument (`-nargs=?`), and the argument 
replaces <args> where it occurs in the following. Register `a` is cleared (let 
@a=''), then each matching line is appended to that register (`y A` performed 
on all matching lines by `g/pattern/`). A new window with a scratch buffer is 
created (`new | setlocal bt=nofile`), and the register is pasted before the 
blank line in the scratch buffer (`put! a`). When `:g/pattern/` is used, all 
following text is taken as a command to be executed on matching lines. Since 
only `y A` is wanted, the `execute` command is used as it stops at the bar.

REDIRECTING OUTPUT                               *vtw-1063-redirecting-output*

This mapping shows an alternative method using redirection. Put the following 
in your vimrc [https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vimrc]. Then, when you are 
satisfied with the regex you last used for searching, press F3 to output the 
`:g/pattern/` results to a new window.

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F3> :redir @a<CR>:g//<CR>:redir END<CR>:new<CR>:put! a<CR>
<

Explanation:

>
    :redir @a         redirect output to register a
    :g//              repeat last global command
    :redir END        end redirection
    :new              create new window
    :put! a           paste register a into new window
<

The following variation uses redirection to append matching lines to a file 
(which will be created if it does not exist). That might be useful to keep a 
temporary copy of matches for several different patterns.

>
    nnoremap <silent> <F4> :redir >>matches.tmp<CR>:g//<CR>:redir END<CR>:new matches.tmp<CR>
<

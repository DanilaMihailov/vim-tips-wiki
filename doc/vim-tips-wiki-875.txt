It took me a while to notice this at :help |:bar|:

'|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands in one line. If you want to use '|' in an argument, precede it with '\'.

When using bar in grep from a shell prompt you would use something like:

>
    grep -i "main\(menu\|tool\)" *
      or
    grep -iE "main(menu|tool)" *
<

However, you must remember to add an extra escape to the '|' character in 
your regex when using grep from Vim, like so:

>
    grep -i "main\(menu\\|tool\)" *
      or
    grep -iE "main(menu\|tool)" *
<

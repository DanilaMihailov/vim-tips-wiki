==============================================================================

This tip presents suggestions for useful mappings. To qualify, each mapping 
should be short and should be useful for a common task. Other mappings belong 
in another tip.

This is a collection of unrelated mappings. You probably can't use all of 
them "as-is" at the same time. Assign your own left-hand-side as you see fit.

VISUAL MODE BLOCKWISE INDENT  *vwt-953-visual-mode-blockwise-indent*

This keeps the current visual block selection active after changing indent 
with '<' or '>'. Usually the visual block selection is lost after you shift 
it, which is incredibly annoying.

>
    vmap > >gv
    vmap < <gv
<

RECORD INTO REGISTER 'Q', PLAYBACK WITH 'Q'  *vwt-953-record-into-register-'q',-playback-with-'q'*

Set this map:

>
    nnoremap Q @q
<

For quick recordings just type qq to start recording, then q to stop. You 
don't have to worry about the name this way (you just named the recording 
'q'). Now, to play back the recording you just type Q. This will redefine the 
standard meaning of 'Q', but all that does is enter "Ex" mode which I can live 
without.

COPY  *vwt-953-copy*

To copy text to the end-of-line, you can press y$ or you can use the 
following and press Y instead. This mapping sets up Y to be consistent with 
the C and D operators, which act from the cursor to the end of the line. The 
default behavior of Y is to yank the whole line.

>
    nnoremap Y y$
<

==============================================================================

To copy an entire line, and paste it before the current line:

>
    nnoremap _ ggY``P
<

Use a count to specify the line number (default is line 1). For example, 12_ 
would copy line 12 to before the current line.

DELETE  *vwt-953-delete*

In normal mode, you can press D to delete all characters from the cursor to 
end-of-line. The following mapping allows Ctrl-Delete to do the same, in 
insert mode: :help |i_CTRL-\_CTRL-O|

>
    inoremap <C-Del> <C-\><C-O>D
<

SEARCH  *vwt-953-search*

It's easier to press Space than / for searching:

>
    nmap <Space> /
    nmap <C-Space> ?
<

==============================================================================

Highlight text on the screen matching that under the cursor: Press Ctrl-k to 
start; each subsequent Ctrl-l matches one more character. Uses marks "x" and 
"y", and register "z".

>
    map <C-k> mx
    map <C-l> lmy"zy`x/<C-r>z<CR>`y
<

==============================================================================

Search for word under cursor with * or # 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Searching] in new window:

>
    nmap <C-W>* <C-W>s*
    nmap <C-W># <C-W>s#
<

QUICKFIX  *vwt-953-quickfix*

>
    " map <F3> and <S-F3> to jump between locations in a quickfix list, or
    " differences if in window in diff mode
    nnoremap <expr> <silent> <F3>   (&diff ? "]c" : ":cnext\<CR>")
    nnoremap <expr> <silent> <S-F3> (&diff ? "[c" : ":cprev\<CR>")
<

MOVEMENT  *vwt-953-movement*

>
    " remap j and k to scroll by visual lines
    nnoremap j gj
    nnoremap k gk
<

Another option is to leave 'j' and 'k' at their default and instead map the 
cursor keys for use "precision" scrolling by visual lines. Plus this works in 
insert and visual select modes.

>
    imap <up> <C-O>gk
    imap <down> <C-O>gj
    nmap <up> gk
    nmap <down> gj
    vmap <up> gk
    vmap <down> gj
<

MISCELLANEOUS  *vwt-953-miscellaneous*

You can use a more easily accessed key to enter command-line mode to speed 
your editing, for example:

>
    nnoremap <Space> :
<

For those with non-QWERTY keyboards, for example a Brazillian ABNT2 keyboard, 
you can easily avoid built-in Vim commands in your mapping:

>
    nnoremap ç :
<

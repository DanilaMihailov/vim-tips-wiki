==============================================================================

You can fold sequences of two or more empty lines (may contain whitespace) 
with these settings:

>
    :syn match MyEmptyLines "\(^\s*\n\)\+" fold
    :syn sync fromstart
    :setlocal foldmethod=syntax
<

After entering the above, type `zM` to close all folds, or `zR` to open them.

If you have set '`foldcolumn`' to more than 0 you can open/close the 
empty-line blocks by clicking the '+' or '-' with the mouse in the folder 
column.

Thanks for the tip, it works indeed, but appears to be very slow. Hundreds of 
empty lines have been added on a file I must look at, but it takes 30s before 
I can view the result -any idea ?

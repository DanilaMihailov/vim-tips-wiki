==============================================================================

When editing LaTeX files from Vim, you want to be able to compile latex, 
retrieve a list of errors, step through errors, etc. This tip explains the 
different options. They all work with the quickfix feature of Vim (:help 
|quickfix|), so before using this tip you need to be familiar with the basics 
of quickfix operation.

VIM-LATEX PLUGIN                                    *vwt-627-vim-latex-plugin*

The Vim-LaTeX plugin sets up make, makeprog, and errorformat for compiling 
single latex files on any system. See the vim-latex documentation 
[http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/latex-suite/latex-compiling.html] 
for more details about compiling. The vim-latex compilation has several 
limitations on large multi-document projects which include figures, plots, etc 
where there are more steps to building than just running pdflatex. This makes 
building using the vim-latex provided features somewhat awkward.

If you want to automatically compile and refresh xdvi whenever you write the 
current buffer, you can add the following code into your tex.vim ftplugin.

>
    au BufWritePost *.tex silent call Tex_RunLaTeX()
    au BufWritePost *.tex silent !pkill -USR1 xdvi.bin
<

Note that Vim-LaTeX should be downloaded from its web page 
[http://vim-latex.sf.net]. The version at script#475 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=475] is outdated and will 
not be updated.

AUTOMATIC LATEX PLUGIN                        *vwt-627-automatic-latex-plugin*

The AutomaticLaTeX Plugin [http://atp-vim.sf.net] has a built-in solution for 
compiling LaTeX files when they are changed (using CursorHold and CursorHoldI 
autcommand groups). Compiles documents in the background, and shows a progress 
bar in the Vim status line. It also rewrites the log file into a Vim readable 
form and has options to filter errors, warnings and info messages in the 
QuickFix window. It also has :MakeLatex command which builds the document and 
runs TeX's friends when necessary. Additionally, it includes script#3109 
[https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3109] to provide interface 
to Latexmk [http://www.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/].

This plugin works under Linux and MacOs and for best performance requires a 
recent version of Vim (7.3.468) with Python interface. The plugin has a very 
rich completion, which makes writing LaTeX files much faster and easier. For a 
long list of features see the web page [1] 
[http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net/features.shtml], online documentation 
[http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net/automatic-tex-plugin.html] there are also some 
videos [http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net/videos.shtml] which advertise some nice 
features.

OTHER PLUGINS                                          *vwt-627-other-plugins*

Automatic LaTeX Plugin [http://atp-vim.sf.net] and Vim-LaTeX 
[http://vim-latex.sf.net] are fully flagged plugins, if you prefer a smaller 
solutions there are also these plugins available:
    - LaTeX-Box script#3109 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3109] 
      which is using Latexmk [http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net/features.shtml] 
    - TeX-9 script#3508 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3508] a 
      nice small plugin written in Python 
    - TeX-PDF script#3230 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3230] 
      which uses Makefile if present, otherwise invokes Rubber 
      [https://launchpad.net/rubber] 
    - TeX Mini script#3058 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3058] 
    - vimtex [https://github.com/lervag/vimtex] 


There are also other LaTeX plugins which do not provide interface for 
compilation"
    - AucTex script#162 [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=162] 
    - Tex Autoclose script#920 
      [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=920] 


RUBBER PLUS MAKE                                    *vwt-627-rubber-plus-make*

Rubber [https://launchpad.net/rubber] (`sudo apt-get install rubber`) is a 
wonderful tool for compiling latex files. It knows how many times to compile, 
knows to run bibtex, filters error messages and warnings (so you can ignore 
overfull hboxes until you want to see them), and so on. Rubber combined with 
make is a great fit for Vim's quickfix.

First, create a generic makefile for compiling latex using rubber and place 
it in some global location (I use `~/academic/tools/latex.mk`).

>
    .PHONY: clean
    
    %.pdf: %.tex $(DEPENDS)
    	rubber -f --pdf -s $<
    	rubber-info --check $<
    
    clean:
    	rm -rf *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.log *.pdf *.toc *.snm *.out *.nav tags
<

Edit to your taste. In particular, you might consider updating the clean to 
not remove all pdfs (if you have figures in pdfs) perhaps using rubber 
`--clean` (see rubber's man page). Other changes include ignoring certain 
warnings or passing other options to rubber (see the man page). Also, you 
might add a tags target which runs ctags with the correct options (see 
tag-list documentation [http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/extend.html] for 
ctags arguments).

Now in your `tex.vim` ftplugin add the following lines:

>
    setlocal errorformat=%f:%l:\ %m,%f:%l-%\\d%\\+:\ %m
    if filereadable('Makefile')
      setlocal makeprg=make
    else
      exec "setlocal makeprg=make\\ -f\\ ~/academic/tools/latex.mk\\ " . substitute(bufname("%"),"tex$","pdf", "")
    endif
<

If the current directory does not have a Makefile, it sets makeprog to 
compile using the generic makefile. This works great on single-file latex 
files where a makefile is overkill.

If you have a multi-file, complicated build project, you can create a custom 
makefile for the project. Mine normally start out like:

>
    DEPENDS=intro.tex somesection.tex somethingelse.tex appendix.tex refs.bib
    
    .PHONY: all
    all: mypaper.pdf
    
    include ~/academic/tools/latex.mk
<

and from here you can add more targets, creating figures, etc. Anything make 
can do, you can insert it here.

MANUAL SETUP                                            *vwt-627-manual-setup*

I strongly suggest you use one of the above options, but it is possible to 
set makeprg and errorformat directly and use the built in tex compiler.

>
    let b:tex_flavor = 'pdflatex'
    compiler tex
    set makeprg=pdflatex\ \-file\-line\-error\ \-interaction=nonstopmode
    set errorformat=%f:%l:\ %m
<

While it is possible to grep the output to filter the output from pdflatex, 
using rubber is a much better option since it knows all about filtering and 
compiling more than once.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-627-comments*

In the #Manual setup |vwt-627-manual-setup| section, what's wrong with the 
default makeprg and errorformat set up by the "compiler tex" command? This 
section should probably go first to show what Vim offers out-of-the-box, then 
explain what is wrong with it, THEN present the alternatives. --Fritzophrenic

==============================================================================

You can avoid VBScript and EXEs by using a shortcut to Vim. This is 
especially useful on corporate computers where, for security reasons, 
scripting may be disabled.

>
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\View Source Editor\Editor Name]
    @="C:\\Program Files\\vim\\vim62\\gvim_ie.lnk"
<

This method was tested using Vim 6.2 on Win2K and Vim 6.1 on Win98. Also 
using Vim 7.3 on WinXP.

==============================================================================

Within the registry, you can specify the source editor to be used by Internet 
Explorer when View|Source is selected. Unfortunately, you can't specify a 
quoted filename argument here, i.e. "%1". The editor specified is supposed to 
handle filenames which contain spaces. This will cause problems for Vim 
because Vim treats each space as an argument separator. If an unquoted 
filename contains spaces, Vim treats the filename as multiple arguments and 
will open multiple files instead of one. To workaround this problem a quoted 
filename has to be passed to Vim. This can be done by creating the following 
Visual Basic Script file gVim.vbs:

>
    'gVim.vbs
    'function: Start gvim, combining multiple arguments to single file argument.
    'changes: 20010905: Quoted 'oWShell.Run' filename argument, allowing spaces.
    ' 20010518: Created.
    'author: Freddy Vulto
    option explicit
    dim oWShell, sArg, sFile
    set oWShell = CreateObject("wscript.shell")
    
    ' Loop through arguments
    for each sArg in wscript.arguments
      sFile = sFile & sArg & " "
    next
    sFile = Trim(sFile)
    
    ' Run Vim with file argument and additional arguments:
    ' -R: View file readonly
    ' -c "set syntax=html": Use HTML syntax-highlighting
    oWShell.Run _
    """d:\program files\vim\vim60\gvim.exe """ & _
     "-R """ & sFile & """ " & _
     "-c ""set syntax=html""" & _
     "-c ""set filetype=html"""
    
    ' Destroy script object
    set oWShell = NOTHING
<

The source editor now can be specified by adding the following key to the 
registry:

>
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      Software
        Microsoft
          Internet Explorer
            View Source Editor
              Editor Name (Default) = D:\Programs\Vim\gvim.vbs
<



COMMENTS  *vwt-118-comments*

1. Copy the script into a file named gvim.vbs. A good place to put it is the 
root of your Vim tree (e.g., c:\program files\vim\).

2. Change the path in gvim.vbs to point to your copy of gvim.

3. Save the following as a file named gvim.ie.vbs.reg (or something like 
that):

>
    REGEDIT4
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\View Source Editor\Editor Name]
    @="c:\\Program Files\\vim\\gvim.vbs"
<

4. Change the path in gvim.ie.vbs.reg to point to your copy of gvim.

5. Double click on the file gvim.ie.vbs.reg, or if you're already editing it 
in vim, execute the command line

!start regedit "c:\program files\vim\gvim.ie.vbs.reg"

Of course, you can produce the file name by hitting control-r %.

==============================================================================

I added the registry entry for my Internet Explorer 6 and it works, although 
I only used Editorname=gvim.exe. So it looks like that IE 6 automatically puts 
quotes around filenames (and Vim therefore can read \winnt\temporary internet 
files\... without any issues).

Or am I missing something?

==============================================================================

I added this by just specifying gvim.exe and it works on filenames with 
spaces on IE6.

    1. Open regedit, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
    2. Expand the key "Software"
    3. Expand the key "Microsoft "
    4. Expand the key "Internet Explorer"
    5. Create key "View Source Editor" under "Internet Explorer"
    6. Create key "Editor Name" under "View Source Editor"
    7. Change the default value of key "Editor Name" to something named
       after the view you wish to use, in this example "vi.exe"
    8. Close things up and expand HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
    9. Expand the key "applications"
    10. Create a new subkey under "applications" with the same name from above. Ex "vi.exe"
    11. Create a new subkey under the key created in the last step called shell.
    12. Create a new subkey under shell called open.
    13. Create a new subkey under edit called command.
    14. Change the default value under the key command to the full path to
        your editor in quotes plus "%1" (with the quotes) Ex: "c:\vi\vi.exe" "%1"

An alternative (quick and dirty) solution is to rename notepad.exe (e.g. to 
_notepad.exe), and create a batch file called notepad.bat that runs Vim 
instead. It works for me!

==============================================================================

Just to take this great tip one step farther. Here's how I added syntax 
highlighting to my source code.

" Open html files from Internet Explorer with certain commandsautocmd BufRead 
*\ runtime! syntax/html.vim

==============================================================================

Here's how I added syntax colouring to the sourcecode.

Create a file scripts.vim in your user directory with the following code in. 
See :help |filetype| for more details. This also allows you to start creating 
an html file and type :filetype detect to get syntax highlighting as well. I'm 
sure the detection code can be improved, but it works for a first pass!

>
    if did_filetype()
      finish
    endif
    "Automatic detection of html files.
    let s:line1 = getline(1)
    let s:line2 = getline(2)
    if s:line1 =~ '^<html*' || s:line2 =~ '^<html*'
      set ft=html
    endif
<

==============================================================================

Instead of using regedit to change "View Source Editor" directly, we can also 
use TweakUI for Windows XP (one of the "Powertoys for Windows XP").

Navigate to "Internet Explorer->View Source". Click "Change Program".

It changes the registry for you. (Exactly the same effect as using regedit.)

==============================================================================

When I set this up, I had to create the keys for the View Source Editor, and 
its subkey "Editor Name".

In regedit:

Right away I was able to View Source with VIM. If you have tried to View 
Source before making these changes, I suspect you would have to restart IE or 
even reboot.

==============================================================================

I'm running Win98SE. I've made all the here to mentioned changes to my VB 
script and to _vimrc file and my syntax highlighting still does not work:I 
added this to my _vimrc file.

>
    " Only do this part when compiled with support for autocommands.
    if has("autocmd")
     autocmd BufRead *\[[0-9]] runtime! syntax/html.vim
    endif
<

And I'm using the VB script here:

>
    option explicit
    dim oWShell, sArg, sFile
    
    ' Create script object
    set oWShell = CreateObject("wscript.shell")
    ' Loop through arguments
    for each sArg in wscript.arguments
     sFile = sFile & sArg & " "
    next
    sFile = Trim(sFile)
    ' Run Vim with file argument. Additional arguments:
    ' -R: View file readonly
    ' -c "set syntax=html": Use HTML syntax-highlighting
    ' NOTE: Use "-c ""set ft=html""" to make it work for Vim v6.
    oWShell.Run _
     """C:\Vim\Vim62\gvim.exe """ & _
     "-R """ & sFile & """ " & _
     "-c ""set syntax=html""" & _
     "-c ""set filetype=html"""
    
    ' Destroy script object
    set oWShell = NOTHING
<

This is all straight from this page. I was wondering if anyone else was 
having problems getting the syntax highlighting working under Win98SE.

There seems to be an additional problem if one wants to use e.g. the 
--remote-silent option so that the file opens in an existing gvim session. I 
have the impression that the [-R -c "set ft=html" --remote-files] sequnce does 
not seem to work: the filetype remains unset, and the file is noreadonly. I 
adapted the script so that it first runs gvim --remote-silent to pass the file 
to the current gvim session, and that I use gvim --remote-send to switch to 
readonly and an additional gvim --remote-send to set the filetype. (Didn't 
work if both commands were sent together). Works like a breeze. Here's the 
script as I use it now:

Folks... The space before the last quote is critical... Otherwise, the 
arguments get jumbled like so:

    -c "set syntax=html"-c "set etc..."
     ^^

It works on Winnt 4 with IE 5.5.

viewsource.reg

    REGEDIT4

    D:\vim\vim62\gvim.exe -M -c "set syntax=html" -c "set ft=html" "%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
<

==============================================================================

The following version of viewsource.bat will work even better because it 
won't leave the DOS window open. Also, for reasons unknown, the multiple file 
names problem doesn't occur, however it did with the version in the previous 
note. Leave viewsource.reg as described there; works fine with Windows XP and 
IE 6.

==============================================================================

More on the batchfile option...

If your Vim is installed in a directory with spaces (e.g., c:\Program 
files\Vim\Vim63\gvim.exe), either of the following will work:

>
    start "" "c:\Program files\Vim\Vim63\gvim.exe" -M -c "set syn=html" -c "set ft=html" %1
<

OR

>
    start c:\Progra~1\Vim\Vim63\gvim.exe -M -c "set syn=html" -c "set ft=html" %1
<

The "" in the first is necessary because otherwise "start" will think 
"c:\...\gvim.exe" is the title of the window.

==============================================================================

I extended a previous poster's script.vim addition. Just add the following 
code (between BEGINCODE and ENDCODE) to the bottom of your scripts.vim file 
(mine was at:"C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63") and the script will be run to check 
any file that Vim loads for a line (within the first 3 non-whitespace lines) 
that starts with "<html". This means you don't need the .vbs script, and you 
still get syntax highlighting.

For Mozilla Firefox, Davide Ficano has written a "ViewSourceWith" extension. 
Just follow the link below in Firefox, and click on "Install 
now":https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=394 
[https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=394]

Once installed use:Tools -> ExtensionsA window popsup with your installed 
extension listed. Select "ViewSourceWith" and click "Options".Under "Editor 
list" click "New" and enter the full path to gvim.exe under "Editor path", and 
hey presto!

==============================================================================

With reference to the note above about checking for "<html" in the first 
three lines:I tried this out and found it didn't always work because "<html" 
isn't always at the start of the line.I changed my version to search 
for:^.*<html*instead of:^\s*<html*and now we're all happy.

==============================================================================

This has always worked for me:

Put this in a batch

>
    gvim %1 -c "so $VIMRUNTIME\syntax\html.vim"
<

And change the registry to point to that batch, as in the main tip.

Download http://planetxml.de/php_manual.txt 
[http://planetxml.de/php_manual.txt] and put it into your vim/doc folder, then 
run :helptags [path to vim/doc]. Documentation for PHP functions can be shown 
by pressing K while the cursor is on a function name.

The manual was created using a modified version of script found at

There is a new version available at 
http://blog.planetxml.de/uploads/vim-php-manual.tgz 
[http://blog.planetxml.de/uploads/vim-php-manual.tgz]

I added more text and examples from the manual and it is now split into one 
file per function. Installation has also changed, you have to create a folder 
named 'doc' somewhere and add this to your runtimepath. For example unpack it 
to c:\program\vim\php\doc and add this to your .vimrc: 
runtimepath+=c:\program\vim\php

==============================================================================

I found it necessary to unset keywordprg (which I did in ftplugin/php.vim) so 
that the K defaults to the `:help` command (rather than :!man).

==============================================================================

Based on the information found here 
(http://blog.planetxml.de/archives/16-PHP-Manual-in-VIM-einbinden.html 
[http://blog.planetxml.de/archives/16-PHP-Manual-in-VIM-einbinden.html]) I 
generated a new set of files, updated from the latest cvs phpdoc. The new 
manual includes all new features found in php 5.3.

To generate your own set of files:
    - wget http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?dl=f64c725dd 
      [http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?dl=f64c725dd] -O parser2.php 
    - svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/phpdoc/modules/doc-en 
      [http://svn.php.net/repository/phpdoc/modules/doc-en] phpdoc (or whatever 
      documentation you want, for example doc-jp) 
    - sudo apt-get install pear (on debian based distros) 
    - mkdir out 
    - php parser2.php 


That's all, you'll get your documentation on the "out" folder

==============================================================================

None of the above worked for me (vim 7.2.442, neither on Ubuntu nor Gentoo). 
The vim-php-manual help files above where not recognized with :helptags, the 
produced tags file only had 3 lines in it. Solution was to create my own files 
like suggested above. But i had to uncomment line 206 and comment out 207 in 
parser2.php to get help files in correct vim format.

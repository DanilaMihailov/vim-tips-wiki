==============================================================================

By default when a tab is closed, if another tab is open to the right of the 
tab that was just closed, it will become the "in focus" or current tab. 
However, when editing quickly this does not provide symmetry with the :tabopen 
command, because the :tabopen command opens a new tab to the right, and the 
:tabclose does restore focus to the original tab upon closing. With the 
following command in the .vimrc file, when editing a file, if the user needs 
to do something quickly in a new tab, they can use a mapping to close it and 
return to the original tab.

>
    noremap <silent><C-S-w> :if tabpagenr() != tabpagenr('$')<CR>:tabclose<CR>:if tabpagenr() > 1<CR>:tabprev<CR>:endif<CR>:else<CR>:tabclose<CR>:endif<CR>

The following accomplishes the same as above, but if a tab is not being 
closed, will just call the :q command.

>
    function! CloseSomething()
      if winnr("$") == 1 && tabpagenr("$") > 1 && tabpagenr() > 1 && tabpagenr() < tabpagenr("$")
        tabclose | tabprev
      else
        q
      endif
    endfunction
    map <C-x> :call CloseSomething()<CR>

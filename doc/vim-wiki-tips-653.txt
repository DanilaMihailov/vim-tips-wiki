==============================================================================

This will continue lines of `///` doxygen [http://www.doxygen.org] comments 
when you reach the end of a line while typing a comment. It also works if you 
use `o` to open a new line while on a comment starting with `///`. It only 
works if there is a space between the last `/` and the first letter of the 
comment, that is no big deal, since it lends itself to readability. So for 
example:

>
    /// This will work.
    ///This won't.
<

Here is the magic line. Make sure you put it somewhere that will get sourced 
whenever you open a file you want to use with doxygen. I have it in 
~/.vim/after/ftplugin/c/c.vim, so it gets sourced for all C and C++ files.

>
    set comments=sO:*\ -,mO:*\ \ ,exO:*/,s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,bO:///,O://
<

All other comments will continue to work as expected.

COMMENTS                                                    *vwt-653-comments*

I use:

>
    set comments-=://
    set comments+=:///,://
<

True, it puts them at the end of the comment expression list, but I don't 
think that will be a problem. This way, I don't have to worry about any other 
comment expressions that may be present.

Keep in mind that loading a new syntax file overwrites whatever you have set 
"comments" to be.Add this to your vimrc if you don't want to keep retyping 
"set comments..."

>
    autocmd FileType c,cpp set comments-=://
    autocmd FileType c,cpp set comments+=://!
    autocmd FileType c,cpp set comments+=://
<

==============================================================================

I think, for the .vimrc, the post just above should read:

>
    autocmd FileType c,cpp set comments-=://
    autocmd FileType c,cpp set comments+=:///
    autocmd FileType c,cpp set comments+=://
<

That's what worked for me. - Chris B

Or just use ^= instead of += to prepend the new option:

>
    autocmd Filetype c,cpp set comments^=:///

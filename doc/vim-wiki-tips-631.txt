==============================================================================

Often, your Windows locale will reflect a foreign country (e.g. Japan) so you 
can write text in another character set, but you don't want Vim to do that by 
default. It is annoying to have to disable IME input every time you start up 
Vim. But it's much easier than that. Simply add this line to your vimrc:

>
    set iminsert=0
<

Now, you will start out in regular Roman input mode, without IME.

imcmdline and imsearch can also be disabled in the same way.

    set imdisable

==============================================================================

I was once editing a file and wanted to test something. The test was meant to 
add a line at the end of the file, from outside Vim. All was fine, but instead 
of >> to append the output to the file, I wrote > to replace the file with the 
output by mistake.

If you happen to do something like that, the solution is:

>
    :recover
<

This command only works if you have a swap file. If you do not have a swap 
file, the recover command will not work.

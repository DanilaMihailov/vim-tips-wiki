==============================================================================

Following is a big timesaver if you need to open lots of files.

Assume you have a text file containing filenames with or without paths 
(created by for instance 'grep -Erl "^" * > files.txt'). Following opens all 
these files in the same vim.

Assuming that only this text file is opened:

Set the cursor on the first line. In normal mode, type:

>
    q0gf:rew<CR><DOWN-ARROW>q
<

This loads the file on the first line, and creates macro '0'.

Check the number of lines with <CTRL-g> and subtract one for the first line. 
Type this value, then:

>
    @0
<

This loads the remaining files.

How about:

>
    bash> gvim $(grep -l *.* string)
<

Or

>
    bash> grep -n *.* string > list
    bash> vim -q list .. you can visit each file:line with :cnext, :cprev
<

Or

>
    bash> find . -name *.* | xargs grep -l string | vim -
<

No macro, it is all builtin.

==============================================================================

Returning to original tip: "Assume you have a text file containing filenames 
with or without paths". Very easy and elegant way to run through these files 
is the following (supposing there is no spaces around filenames):

Open the file then enter:

>
    :setlocal efm=%f
    :execute 'cfile '.expand('%')
<

Last command may be replaced with typing :cfile <c-r>%<CR>

Now you may navigate through these files using copen, cnext, cNext, cfirst, 
clast.

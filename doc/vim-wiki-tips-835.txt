==============================================================================

This tip is relevant to those who use the "Intellisense" functionality for 
vim (http://insenvim.sourceforge.net [http://insenvim.sourceforge.net]) for 
C++. This requires, as a part of its setup, that the paths for all the 
included header files in a C++ file be present in the $INCLUDE variable. This 
is fine so long as all your header files are in one (invariant) location (say 
the MSVC's include directory). However, if your C++ file includes header files 
in locations relative to the current file, updating the INCLUDE environment 
variable is not an option.

For example, if your header files are in the same directory as your source 
file, simply add the following line to the cpp_vis.vim file that is delivered 
to the vimfiles\ftplugin location:

>
    let $INCLUDE = expand("%:p:h") . ";" . $INCLUDE
<

To include other relative paths, simply tweak the argument to expand(). See 
:help |filename-modifiers|.

==============================================================================

You can use CTRL-O or CTRL-\ CTRL-O (see :help |ins-special-special|) to 
execute a normal-mode command without leaving insert mode. But this is awkward 
for frequently used commands. Even mapping keys like <F5> or CTRL key 
combinations can be difficult to reach, and there are not many available keys 
to map 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Mapping_keys_in_Vim_-_Tutorial_(Part_2)#Finding_unused_keys]. 
If you want quick access to common normal-mode commands from insert mode, 
hitting <ESC> to actually go to normal mode may not be attractive.

You can Avoid the escape key 
[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key], but it can be faster to 
map double uppercase letters in insert mode to common commands. Most people 
don't use two uppercase letters in a row. If you do actually need to insert 
any text from these mappings, you can always type CTRL-V before the second 
character in the mapping (:help |i_CTRL-V|), or wait for the mapping to time 
out first.

    - AA go to the end of the line 
    - OO start editing on a new line above the current line

    - CC change what is on the right of the cursor 
    - SS change the whole line

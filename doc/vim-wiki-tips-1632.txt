==============================================================================

It is often useful to record a macro – a series of commands that can be 
re-executed. This tip shows how to use a macro to move blocks of text: record 
the commands to move the first block, then replay the commands to move further 
blocks.

MOVING BLOCKS OF TEXT                         *vwt-1632-moving-blocks-of-text*

One might have many blocks of text that are clearly delimited, but which need 
the order reversed, as in this example:

>
    <div class="myblock">
        ... html for first block, multiple lines ...
    </div>
    <div class="myblock">
        ... html for second block, multiple lines ...
    </div>
    <div class="myblock">
        ... html for third block, multiple lines ...
    </div>
<

To solve this problem, observe that the first block does not need to be 
moved. Go to the last line of the first block (in this case the </div>) then 
record a macro by typing:

ma (set mark 'a')
qa (start recording a macro to register a)
jV/<\/div><CR> (select the next block – these commands work for this example)
:m0<CR> (move the block to the beginning of the file)
'a (return to mark 'a')
q (finish recording macro)

Now you should be able to run the macro with @a (and then @@ for each 
subsequent run) for each block you need to move.

For the impatient, move to the last line of your block and type 
maqajV/<\/div><CR>:m0<CR>'aq@a@@@@@@@@; keep doing @@ until the file is 
reordered appropriately.

Note that this won't work for nested <div> tags (in this example). The 
matchit.vim extension may allow you to use % instead.
